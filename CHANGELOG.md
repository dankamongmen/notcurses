This document attempts to list user-visible changes and any major internal
rearrangements of Notcurses.

* 1.2.6 (not yet released)
  * ncplane_putsimple_yx() has been exported as a static inline function.
  * ncplane_set_scrolling() has been added, allowing control over whether a
    plane scrolls. All planes, including the standard plane, do not scroll by
    default. If scrolling is enabled, text output via the `*put*` family of
    functions continues onto the next line when encountering the end of a row.
    This does not apply to e.g. boxes or lines.
  * ncplane_putstr_yx() now always returns the inverse of the number of columns
    advanced on an error (it used to return the positive short count so long as
    the error was due to plane geometry, not bad input).

* 1.2.5
  * Add ncplot, with support for sliding-windowed horizontal histograms.
  * gradient, polyfill, ncplane_format() and ncplane_stain() all now return the
   number of cells written on success. Failure still sees -1 returned.
  * `ncvisual_render()` now returns the number of cells emitted on success, as
    opposed to 0. Failure still sees -1 returned.
  * `ncvisual_render()` now interprets length parameters of -1 to mean "to the
   end along this axis", and no longer interprets 0 to mean this. 0 now means
   "a length of 0", resulting in a zero-area rendering.
  * `notcurses_at_yx()` no longer accepts a `cell*` as its last parameter.
   Instead, it accepts a `uint32_t*` and a `uint64_t*`, and writes the
   attribute and channels to these parameters. This was done because the
   `gcluster` field of the `cell*` was always set to 0, which was surprising
   and a source of blunders. The EGC is returned via the `char*` return
   value. https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/issues/410

* 1.2.4 2020-03-24
  * Add ncmultiselector
  * Add `ncdirect_cursor_enable()` and `ncdirect_cursor_disable()`.
