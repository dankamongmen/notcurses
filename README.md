## Introduction

* **What it is**: a library facilitating complex TUIs on modern terminal
    emulators, supporting vivid colors and Unicode to the maximum degree
    possible. Many tasks delegated to Curses can be achieved using notcurses
    (and vice versa).

* **What it is not**: a source-compatible X/Open Curses implementation, nor a
    replacement for NCURSES on existing systems, nor a widely-ported and -tested
    bedrock of Open Source, nor a battle-proven, veteran library.

notcurses abandons the X/Open Curses API bundled as part of the Single UNIX
Specification. The latter shows its age, and seems not capable of making use of
terminal functionality such as unindexed 24-bit color ("DirectColor", not to be
confused with 8-bit indexed 24-bit color, aka "TrueColor" or (by NCURSES) as
"extended color"). For some necessary
background, consult Thomas E. Dickey's superb and authoritative [NCURSES
FAQ](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#xterm_16MegaColors).
As such, notcurses is not a drop-in Curses replacement. It is almost certainly
less portable, and definitely tested on less hardware. Sorry about that.
Ultimately, I hope to properly support all terminals *supporting the features
necessary for complex TUIs*. I would argue that teletypes etc. are
fundamentally unsuitable. Most operating systems seem reasonable targets, but I
only have Linux and FreeBSD available for testing.

Whenever possible, notcurses makes use of the Terminfo library shipped with
NCURSES, benefiting greatly from its portability and thoroughness.

notcurses opens up advanced functionality for the interactive user on
workstations, phones, laptops, and tablets, at the expense of e.g.
industrial and retail terminals (or even the Linux virtual console,
which offers only eight colors and limited glyphs).

Why use this non-standard library?

* Thread safety, and efficient use in parallel programs, has been a design
  consideration from the beginning.

* A svelter design than that codified by X/Open.
  * Exported identifiers are prefixed to avoid common namespace collisions.
  * The library object exports a minimal set of symbols. Where reasonable,
    `static inline` header-only code is used. This facilitates compiler
    optimizations, and reduces loader time.

* All APIs natively suport UTF-8. The `cell` API is based around Unicode's
  [Extended Grapheme Cluster](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/) concept.

* Visual features including images, fonts, video, high-contrast text, sprites,
  and transparent regions. All APIs natively support 24-bit color, quantized
  down as necessary for the terminal.

* It's Apache2-licensed in its entirety, as opposed to the
  [drama in several acts](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-license.html)
  that is the NCURSES license (the latter is [summarized](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-license.html#issues_freer)
  as "a restatement of MIT-X11").

Much of the above can be had with NCURSES, but they're not what NCURSES was
*designed* for. The most fundamental advantage in my mind, though, is
that notcurses is of the multithreaded era.

On the other hand, if you're targeting industrial or critical applications,
or wish to benefit from the time-tested reliability and portability of Curses,
you should by all means use that fine library.

## Requirements

* A C11 and a C++14 compiler
* CMake 3.13.0+
* From NCURSES: terminfo 6.1+
* From FFMpeg: libswscale 5.0+, libavformat 57.0+, libavutil 56.0+

## Use

A program wishing to use notcurses will need to link it, ideally using the
output of `pkg-config --libs notcurses`. It is advised to compile with the
output of `pkg-config --cflags notcurses`. If using CMake, a support file is
provided, and can be accessed as `notcurses`.

Before calling into notcurses—and usually as one of the first calls of the
program—be sure to call `setlocale(3)` with an appropriate UTF-8 `LC_ALL`
locale. It is usually appropriate to use `setlocale(LC_ALL, "")`, relying on
the user to properly set the `LANG` environment variable. notcurses will
refuse to start if `nl_langinfo(3)` doesn't indicate UTF-8.

notcurses requires an available `terminfo(5)` definition appropriate for the
terminal. It is usually appropriate to pass `NULL` in the `termtype` field of a
`notcurses_options` struct, relying on the user to properly set the `TERM`
environment variable. This variable is usually set by the terminal itself. It
might be necessary to manually select a higher-quality definition for your
terminal, i.e. `xterm-direct` as opposed to `xterm` or `xterm-256color`.

Each terminal can be prepared via a call to `notcurses_init()`, which is
supplied a struct of type `notcurses_options`:

```c
// Get a human-readable string describing the running notcurses version.
const char* notcurses_version(void);

struct cell;      // a coordinate on an ncplane: an EGC plus styling
struct ncplane;   // a drawable notcurses surface, composed of cells
struct notcurses; // notcurses state for a given terminal, composed of ncplanes

// Configuration for notcurses_init().
typedef struct notcurses_options {
  // The name of the terminfo database entry describing this terminal. If NULL,
  // the environment variable TERM is used. Failure to open the terminal
  // definition will result in failure to initialize notcurses.
  const char* termtype;
  // If smcup/rmcup capabilities are indicated, notcurses defaults to making
  // use of the "alternate screen". This flag inhibits use of smcup/rmcup.
  bool inhibit_alternate_screen;
  // By default, we hide the cursor if possible. This flag inhibits use of
  // the civis capability, retaining the cursor.
  bool retain_cursor;
  // We typically install a signal handler for SIGINT and SIGQUIT that restores
  // the screen, and then calls the old signal handler. Set this to inhibit
  // registration of any signal handlers.
  bool no_quit_sighandlers;
  // We typically install a signal handler for SIGWINCH that generates a resize
  // event in the notcurses_getc() queue. Set this to inhibit the handler.
  bool no_winch_sighandler;
  // If non-NULL, notcurses_render() will write each rendered frame to this
  // FILE* in addition to outfp. This is used primarily for debugging.
  FILE* renderfp;
} notcurses_options;

// Initialize a notcurses context on the connected terminal at 'fp'. 'fp' must
// be a tty. You'll usually want stdout. Returns NULL on error, including any
// failure to initialize terminfo.
struct notcurses* notcurses_init(const notcurses_options* opts, FILE* fp);

// Destroy a notcurses context.
int notcurses_stop(struct notcurses* nc);
```

`notcurses_stop` should be called before exiting your program to restore the
terminal settings and free resources.

The vast majority of the notcurses API draws into virtual buffers. Only upon
a call to `notcurses_render` will the visible terminal display be updated to
reflect the changes:

```c
// Make the physical screen match the virtual screen. Changes made to the
// virtual screen (i.e. most other calls) will not be visible until after a
// successful call to notcurses_render().
int notcurses_render(struct notcurses* nc);
```

Utility functions operating on the toplevel `notcurses` object include:

```c
// Refresh our idea of the terminal's dimensions, reshaping the standard plane
// if necessary. Without a call to this function following a terminal resize
// (as signaled via SIGWINCH), notcurses_render() might not function properly.
// References to ncplanes remain valid following a resize operation, but the
// cursor might have changed position.
int notcurses_resize(struct notcurses* n, int* RESTRICT y, int* RESTRICT x);

// Refresh the physical screen to match what was last rendered (i.e., without
// reflecting any changes since the last call to notcurses_render()). This is
// primarily useful if the screen is externally corrupted.
int notcurses_refresh(struct notcurses* n);

// Get a reference to the standard plane (one matching our current idea of the
// terminal size) for this terminal.
struct ncplane* notcurses_stdplane(struct notcurses* nc);
const struct ncplane* notcurses_stdplane_const(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Create a new ncplane at the specified offset (relative to the standard plane)
// and the specified size. The number of rows and columns must both be positive.
// This plane is initially at the top of the z-buffer, as if ncplane_move_top()
// had been called on it. The void* 'opaque' can be retrieved (and reset) later.
struct ncplane* notcurses_newplane(struct notcurses* nc, int rows, int cols,
                                   int yoff, int xoff, void* opaque);

// Returns a 16-bit bitmask in the LSBs of supported curses-style attributes
// (CELL_STYLE_UNDERLINE, CELL_STYLE_BOLD, etc.) The attribute is only
// indicated as supported if the terminal can support it together with color.
unsigned notcurses_supported_styles(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Returns the number of colors supported by the palette, or 1 if there is no
// color support.
int notcurses_palette_size(const struct notcurses* nc);
```

### Input

Input can currently be taken only from `stdin`, but on the plus side, stdin
needn't be a terminal device (unlike the ttyfp `FILE*` passed in a
`notcurses_options`). Generalized input ought happen soon. There is only one
input queue per `struct notcurses`.

Like NCURSES, notcurses will watch for escape sequences, check them against the
terminfo database, and return them as special keys (we hijack the Private Use
Area, specifically Supplementary Private Use Area B (u100000 through u10ffffd),
for special keys). Unlike NCURSES, the fundamental unit of input is the
UTF8-encoded Unicode codepoint. Note, however, that only one codepoint is
returned at a time (as opposed to an entire EGC).

```c
// All input is currently taken from stdin, though this will likely change. We
// attempt to read a single UTF8-encoded Unicode codepoint, *not* an entire
// Extended Grapheme Cluster. It is also possible that we will read a special
// keypress, i.e. anything that doesn't correspond to a Unicode codepoint (e.g.
// arrow keys, function keys, screen resize events, etc.). These are mapped
// into Unicode's Supplementary Private Use Area-B, starting at U+100000.
//
// notcurses_getc() and notcurses_getc_nblock() are both nonblocking.
// notcurses_getc_blocking() blocks until a codepoint or special key is read,
// or until interrupted by a signal.
//
// In the case of a valid read, a positive value is returned corresponding to
// the number of bytes in the UTF-8 character, or '1' for all special keys.
// 0 is returned to indicate that no input was available, but only by
// notcurses_getc(). Otherwise (including on EOF) -1 is returned.

// is this wide character a Supplementary Private Use Area-B codepoint?

### Planes

Fundamental to notcurses is a z-buffer of rectilinear virtual screens, known
as `ncplane`s. An `ncplane` can be larger than the physical screen, or smaller,
or the same size; it can be entirely contained within the physical screen, or
overlap in part, or lie wholly beyond the boundaries, never to be rendered.
Each `ncplane` has a current writing state (cursor position, foreground and
background color, etc.), a backing array of `cell`s, and a z-index. If
opaque, a `cell` on a higher `ncplane` completely obstructs a corresponding `cell`
from a lower `ncplane` from being seen. An `ncplane` corresponds loosely to an
[NCURSES Panel](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-intro.html#panels),
but is the primary drawing surface of notcurses—there is no object
corresponding to a bare NCURSES `WINDOW`.

```c
// Resize the specified ncplane. The four parameters 'keepy', 'keepx',
// 'keepleny', and 'keeplenx' define a subset of the ncplane to keep,
// unchanged. This may be a section of size 0, though none of these four
// parameters may be negative. 'keepx' and 'keepy' are relative to the ncplane.
// They must specify a coordinate within the ncplane's totality. 'yoff' and
// 'xoff' are relative to 'keepy' and 'keepx', and place the upper-left corner
// of the resized ncplane. Finally, 'ylen' and 'xlen' are the dimensions of the
// ncplane after resizing. 'ylen' must be greater than or equal to 'keepleny',
// and 'xlen' must be greater than or equal to 'keeplenx'. It is an error to
// attempt to resize the standard plane. If either of 'keepy' or 'keepx' is
// non-zero, both must be non-zero.
//
// Essentially, the kept material does not move. It serves to anchor the
// resized plane. If there is no kept material, the plane can move freely:
// it is possible to implement ncplane_move() in terms of ncplane_resize().
int ncplane_resize(struct ncplane* n, int keepy, int keepx, int keepleny,
                       int keeplenx, int yoff, int xoff, int ylen, int xlen);

// Destroy the specified ncplane. None of its contents will be visible after
// the next call to notcurses_render(). It is an error to attempt to destroy
// the standard plane.
int ncplane_destroy(struct ncplane* ncp);

// Set the ncplane's background cell to this cell. It will be rendered anywhere
// that the ncplane's gcluster is 0. The default background is all zeroes.
// Erasing the ncplane does not eliminate the background.

### Cells

Unlike the `notcurses` or `ncplane` objects, the definition of `cell` is
available to the user:

```c
// A cell corresponds to a single character cell on some plane, which can be
// occupied by a single grapheme cluster (some root spacing glyph, along with
// possible combining characters, which might span multiple columns). At any
// cell, we can have a theoretically arbitrarily long UTF-8 string, a foreground
// color, a background color, and an attribute set. Valid grapheme cluster
// contents include:
//
//  * A NUL terminator,
//  * A single control character, followed by a NUL terminator,
//  * At most one spacing character, followed by zero or more nonspacing
//    characters, followed by a NUL terminator.
//
// Multi-column characters can only have a single style/color throughout.
//
// Each cell occupies 16 static bytes (128 bits). The surface is thus ~1.6MB
// for a (pretty large) 500x200 terminal. At 80x43, it's less than 64KB.
// Dynamic requirements can add up to 16MB to an ncplane, but such large pools
// are unlikely in common use.
typedef struct cell {
  // These 32 bits are either a single-byte, single-character grapheme cluster
  // (values 0--0x7f), or an offset into a per-ncplane attached pool of
  // varying-length UTF-8 grapheme clusters. This pool may thus be up to 32MB.
  uint32_t gcluster;          // 1 * 4b -> 4b
  // CELL_STYLE_* attributes (16 bits) + 16 reserved bits
  uint32_t attrword;          // + 4b -> 8b
  // (channels & 0x8000000000000000ull): left half of wide character
  // (channels & 0x4000000000000000ull): foreground is *not* "default color"
  // (channels & 0x3000000000000000ull): foreground alpha (2 bits)
  // (channels & 0x0f00000000000000ull): reserved, must be 0
  // (channels & 0x00ffffff00000000ull): foreground in 3x8 RGB (rrggbb)
  // (channels & 0x0000000080000000ull): right half of wide character
  // (channels & 0x0000000040000000ull): background is *not* "default color"
  // (channels & 0x0000000030000000ull): background alpha (2 bits)
  // (channels & 0x000000000f000000ull): reserved, must be 0
  // (channels & 0x0000000000ffffffull): background in 3x8 RGB (rrggbb)
  // At render time, these 24-bit values are quantized down to terminal
  // capabilities, if necessary. There's a clear path to 10-bit support should
  // we one day need it, but keep things cagey for now. "default color" is
  // best explained by color(3NCURSES). ours is the same concept. until the
  // "not default color" bit is set, any color you load will be ignored.
  uint64_t channels;          // + 8b == 16b
} cell;
```

A `cell` ought be initialized with `CELL_TRIVIAL_INITIALIZER` or the
`cell_init()` function before it is further used. These just zero out the
`cell`. A `cell` has three fundamental elements:

* The EGC displayed at this coordinate, encoded in UTF-8. If the EGC is a
  single ASCII character (value less than 0x80), it is stored inline in
  the `cell`'s `gcluster` field. Otherwise, `gcluster`'s top 24 bits
  are a 128-biased offset into the associated `ncplane`'s egcpool. This
  implies that `cell`s are associated with `ncplane`s once prepared.
* The Curses-style attributes of the text, and a 16-bit alpha channel.
* The 48 bits of foreground and background RGB, plus a few flags.

The EGC should be loaded using `cell_load()`. Either a single NUL-terminated
EGC can be provided, or a string composed of multiple EGCs. In the latter case,
the first EGC from the string is loaded. Remember, backing storage for the EGC
is provided by the `ncplane` passed to `cell_load()`; if this `ncplane` is
destroyed (or even erased), the `cell` cannot safely be used. If you're done
using the `cell` before being done with the `ncplane`, call `cell_release()`
to free up the EGC resources.

```c
#define CELL_TRIVIAL_INITIALIZER { .gcluster = '\0', .attrword = 0, .channels = 0, }

static inline void
cell_init(cell* c){
  memset(c, 0, sizeof(*c));

### Multimedia

Media decoding and scaling is handled by libAV from FFmpeg, resulting in a
`notcurses_visual` object. This object generates frames, each one corresponding
to a renderable scene on the associated `ncplane`.

```c
// open a visual (image or video), associating it with the specified ncplane.

### Panelreels

Panelreels are a complex UI abstraction offered by notcurses, derived from my
similar work in [outcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/outcurses#Panelreels).

**FIXME**

### Channels

A channel encodes 24 bits of RGB color, using 8 bits for each component. It
additionally provides 2 bits of alpha channel, a bit for selecting terminal
default colors, and a bit to indicate whether it describes a Wide East Asian
character. The remaining four bits are reserved. Typically two channels are
bound together in a 64-bit unsigned integer (`uint64_t`), with eight bits
currently going unused. There is such a double-channel in every `cell` and
`ncplane` object.

Usually, the higher-level `ncplane` and `cell` functionality ought be used. It
will sometimes be necessary, however, to muck with channels at their lowest
level. The channel API facilitates such muckery. All channel-related `ncplane`
and `cell` functionality is implemented in terms of this API.

```c
// Extract the 8-bit red component from a 32-bit channel.

### Perf

notcurses tracks statistics across its operation, and a snapshot can be
acquired using the `notcurses_stats()` function. This function cannot fail.

```c
typedef struct ncstats {
  uint64_t renders;          // number of notcurses_render() runs
  uint64_t render_bytes;     // bytes emitted to ttyfp
  uint64_t render_max_bytes; // max bytes emitted for a frame
  uint64_t render_min_bytes; // min bytes emitted for a frame
  uint64_t render_ns;        // nanoseconds spent in notcurses_render()
  int64_t render_max_ns;     // max ns spent in notcurses_render()
  int64_t render_min_ns;     // min ns spent in successful notcurses_render()
  uint64_t fbbytes;          // total bytes devoted to all active framebuffers
  uint64_t fgelisions;       // RGB fg elision count
  uint64_t fgemissions;      // RGB fg emissions
  uint64_t bgelisions;       // RGB bg elision count
  uint64_t bgemissions;      // RGB bg emissions
  uint64_t defaultelisions;  // default color was emitted
  uint64_t defaultemissions; // default color was elided
} ncstats;

// Acquire a snapshot of the notcurses object's stats.
void notcurses_stats(const struct notcurses* nc, ncstats* stats);
```

Timings for renderings are across the breadth of `notcurses_render()`: they
include all per-render preprocessing, output generation, and dumping of the
output (including any sleeping while waiting on the terminal).

The notcurses rendering algorithm starts by moving the physical cursor to the
upper left corner of the visible screen (it does *not* clear the screen
beforehand). At each coordinate, it finds the topmost visible `ncplane`. There
will always be at least one `ncplane` visible at each coordinate, due to the
default plane. Once the plane is determined, the damage map is consulted to see
whether the cell need be redrawn. If so, it will be redrawn, and the virtual
cursor is updated based on the width of the output. Along the way, notcurses
attempts to minimize total amount of data written by eliding unnecessary color
and style specifications, and moving the cursor over large unchanged areas.

The worst case input frame (in terms of output size) is one whose colors change
from coordinate to coordinate, uses multiple combining characters within each
grapheme cluster, and has a large geometry. Peculiarities of the terminal
make it impossible to comment more meaningfully regarding delay.

Using the "default color" as only one of the foreground or background requires
emitting the `op` escape followed by the appropriate escape for changing the
fore- or background (since `op` changes both at once). If you're printing full
block characters, it's for this reason better to give them all the same
meaningless background color than to leave the background on the default. If
you're printing spaces, you likewise want a meaningless foreground color. For
a long string of such cells, eliding these ops can be a nice savings. See
[Issue #131](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/issues/131), though;
I'll likely natively handle this within `notcurses_render()` soon.

## Included tools

Four binaries are built as part of notcurses:
* `notcurses-demo`: some demonstration code
* `notcurses-view`: renders visual media (images/videos)
* `notcurses-input`: decode and print keypresses
* `notcurses-tester`: unit testing

## Differences from NCURSES

The biggest difference, of course, is that notcurses is not an implementation
of X/Open (aka XSI) Curses, nor part of SUS4-2018.

The detailed differences between notcurses and NCURSES probably can't be fully
enumerated, and if they could, no one would want to read it. With that said,
some design decisions might surprise NCURSES programmers:

* The screen is not cleared on entry.
* There is no distinct `PANEL` type. The z-buffer is a fundamental property,
  and all drawable surfaces are ordered along the z axis. There is no
  equivalent to `update_panels()`.
* Scrolling is disabled by default, and cannot be globally enabled.
* The Curses `cchar_t` has a fixed-size array of `wchar_t`. The notcurses
  `cell` instead supports a UTF-8 encoded extended grapheme cluster of
  arbitrary length. The only supported charsets are `C` and `UTF-8`. notcurses
  does not generally make use of `wchar_t`.
* The hardware cursor is disabled by default, when supported (`civis` capability).
* Echoing of input is disabled by default, and `cbreak` mode is used by default.
* Colors are always specified as 24 bits in 3 components (RGB). If necessary,
  these will be quantized for the actual terminal. There are no "color pairs".
* There is no distinct "pad" concept (these are NCURSES `WINDOW`s created with
  the `newpad()` function). All drawable surfaces can exceed the display size.
* Multiple threads can freely call into notcurses, so long as they're not
  accessing the same data. In particular, it is always safe to concurrently
  mutate different ncplanes in different threads.
* NCURSES has thread-ignorant and thread-semi-safe versions, trace-enabled and
  traceless versions, and versions with and without support for wide characters.
  notcurses is one library: no tracing, UTF-8, thread safety.
* There is no `ESCDELAY` concept; notcurses expects that all bytes of a
  keyboard escape sequence arrive at the same time. This improves latency
  and simplifies the API.
* It is an error in NCURSES to print to the bottommost, rightmost coordinate of
  the screen when scrolling is disabled (because the cursor cannot be advanced).
  Failure to advance the cursor does not result in an error in notcurses (but
  attempting to print at the cursor when it has been advanced off the plane
  *does*).

### Features missing relative to NCURSES

This isn't "features currently missing", but rather "features I do not intend
to implement".

* There is no immediate-output mode (`immedok()`, `echochar()` etc.).
  `ncplane_putc()` followed by `notcurses_render()` ought be just as fast as
  `echochar()`.
* There is no support for soft labels (`slk_init()`, etc.).
* There is no concept of subwindows which share memory with their parents.
* There is no tracing functionality ala `trace(3NCURSES)`. Superior external
  tracing solutions exist, such as `bpftrace`.

### Adapting NCURSES programs

First off, ask whether you really want to do such a thing. NCURSES and the
Curses API it implements are far more portable and better-tested than notcurses
is ever likely to be. Will the program really benefit from notcurses's advanced
features? If not, it's probably best left as it is.

Otherwise, most NCURSES concepts have clear partners in notcurses. Any functions
making implicit use of `stdscr` ought be replaced with their explicit
equivalents. `stdscr` ought then be replaced with the result of
`notcurses_stdplane()` (the standard plane). `PANEL`s become `ncplane`s; the
Panels API is otherwise pretty close. Anything writing a bare character will
become a simple `cell`; multibyte or wide characters become complex `cell`s.
Color no longer uses "color pairs". You can either hack together a simple table
mapping your colors to RGB values and color pairs to foreground and background
indices into said table.

I have adapted two large (~5k lines of C UI code each) from NCURSES to
notcurses, and found it a fairly painless process. It was helpful to introduce
a shim layer, e.g. `compat_mvwprintw` for NCURSES's `mvwprintw`:

```c
static int
compat_mvwprintw(struct ncplane* nc, int y, int x, const char* fmt, ...){
  if(ncplane_cursor_move_yx(nc, y, x)){
    return ERR;
  }
  va_list va;
  va_start(va, fmt);
  if(ncplane_vprintf(nc, fmt, va) < 0){
    va_end(va);
    return ERR;
  }
  va_end(va);
  return OK;
}
```

## Environment notes

* If your terminal has an option about default interpretation of "ambiguous-width
  characters" (this is actually a technical term from Unicode), ensure it is
  set to **Wide**, not narrow.

* If you can disable BiDi in your terminal, do so while running notcurses
  applications, until I have that handled better. notcurses doesn't recognize
  the BiDi state machine transitions, and thus merrily continues writing
  left-to-right. ﷽

* The unit tests assume dimensions of at least 80x25. They might work in a
  smaller terminal. They might not. Don't file bugs on it.

### History

* 2019-12-05: notcurses [0.4.0 "TRAP MUSIC ALL NIGHT LONG"](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/releases/tag/v0.4.0),
    the first generally usable notcurses. I prepare a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEv2YRyiEVM),
    and release it on YouTube.
* November 2019: I begin work on [Outcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/outcurses).
    Outcurses is a collection of routines atop NCURSES, including Panelreels.
    I study the history of NCURSES, primarily using Thomas E. Dickey's FAQ and
    the mailing list archives.
    * 2019-11-14: I file [Ourcurses issue #56](https://github.com/dankamongmen/outcurses/issues/56)
      regarding use of DirectColor in outcurses. This is partially inspired by
      Lexi Summer Hale's essay [everything you ever wanted to know about terminals](http://xn--rpa.cc/irl/term.html).
      I get into contact with Thomas E. Dickey and confirm that what I'm hoping
      to do doesn't really fit in with the codified Curses API.
    * 2019-11-16: I make the [first commit](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/commit/635d7039d79e4f94ba645e8cb601e3a6d82a6b30)
      to notcurses.
* September 2019: I extracted fade routines from Growlight and Omphalos, and
    offered them to NCURSES as extensions. They are not accepted, which is
    understandable. I mention that I intend to extract Panelreels, and offer to
    include them in the CDK (Curses Development Kit). [Growlight issue #43](https://github.com/dankamongmen/growlight/issues/43)
    is created regarding this extraction. A few minor patches go into NCURSES.
* 2011, 2013: I develop [Growlight](https://github.com/dankamongmen/growlight)
    and [Omphalos](https://github.com/dankamongmen/omphalos), complicated TUIs
    making extensive use of NCURSES.

### Thanks

* Notcurses could never be what it is without decades of tireless, likely
    thankless work by Thomas E. Dickey on NCURSES. His FAQ is a model of
    engineering history. He exemplifies documentation excellence and
    conservative, thoughtful stewardship. The Open Source community owes
    Mr. Dickey a great debt.
* Justine Tunney, one of my first friends at Google NYC, was always present
    with support, and pointed out the useful memstream functionality of
    POSIX, eliminating the need for me to cons up something similar.
* I one night read the entirety of Lexi Summer Hale's [essays](http://xn--rpa.cc/irl/index.html),
    and woke up intending to write notcurses.
* Finally, the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) and general
    l33t scene of the 90s and early twenty-first century endlessly inspired a
    young hax0r. There is great joy in computing; no one will drive us from
    this paradise Turing has created!
