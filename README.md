## Introduction

* **What it is**: a library facilitating complex TUIs on modern terminal
    emulators, supporting vivid colors and Unicode to the maximum degree
    possible. Many tasks delegated to Curses can be achieved using notcurses
    (and vice versa).

* **What it is not**: a source-compatible X/Open Curses implementation, nor a
    replacement for NCURSES on existing systems, nor a widely-ported and -tested
    bedrock of free software, nor a battle-proven, veteran library.

notcurses abandons the X/Open Curses API bundled as part of the Single UNIX
Specification. The latter shows its age, and seems not capable of making use of
terminal functionality such as unindexed 24-bit color ("DirectColor", not to be
confused with 8-bit indexed 24-bit color, aka "TrueColor" or (by NCURSES) as
"extended color"). For some necessary background, consult Thomas E. Dickey's
superb and authoritative [NCURSES FAQ](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#xterm_16MegaColors).
As such, notcurses is not a drop-in Curses replacement. It is almost certainly
less portable, and definitely tested on less hardware. Sorry about that.
Ultimately, I hope to properly support all terminals *supporting the features
necessary for complex TUIs*. I would argue that teletypes etc. are
fundamentally unsuitable. Most operating systems seem reasonable targets, but I
only have Linux and FreeBSD available for testing.

Whenever possible, notcurses makes use of the Terminfo library shipped with
NCURSES, benefiting greatly from its portability and thoroughness.

notcurses opens up advanced functionality for the interactive user on
workstations, phones, laptops, and tablets, at the expense of e.g.
industrial and retail terminals (or even the Linux virtual console,
which offers only eight colors and limited glyphs).

Why use this non-standard library?

* Thread safety, and efficient use in parallel programs, has been a design
  consideration from the beginning.

* A svelter design than that codified by X/Open:
  * Exported identifiers are prefixed to avoid common namespace collisions.
  * The library object exports a minimal set of symbols. Where reasonable,
    `static inline` header-only code is used. This facilitates compiler
    optimizations, and reduces loader time.

* All APIs natively (and exclusively) support UTF-8. The `cell` API is based
  around Unicode's [Extended Grapheme Cluster](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/) concept.

* Visual features including images, fonts, video, high-contrast text, sprites,
  and transparent regions. All APIs natively support 24-bit color, quantized
  down as necessary for the terminal.

* It's Apache2-licensed in its entirety, as opposed to the
  [drama in several acts](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-license.html)
  that is the NCURSES license (the latter is [summarized](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-license.html#issues_freer)
  as "a restatement of MIT-X11").

Much of the above can be had with NCURSES, but they're not what NCURSES was
*designed* for. The most fundamental advantage in my mind, though, is
that notcurses is of the multithreaded era. On the other hand, if you're
targeting industrial or critical applications, or wish to benefit from the
time-tested reliability and portability of Curses, you should by all means use
that fine library.

## Requirements

* A C11 and a C++17 compiler
* CMake 3.14.0+
* From NCURSES: terminfo 6.1+
* (OPTIONAL) From FFMpeg: libswscale 5.0+, libavformat 57.0+, libavutil 56.0+
* (documentation) [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html) 1.19.2+
* (Python bindings): Python + CFFI

### Building

* Create a subdirectory, traditionally `build`. Enter the directory.
* `cmake ..`. You might want to set e.g. `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.
* `make`
* `make test`

If you have unit test failures, *please* file a bug including the output of
`./notcurses-tester > log 2>&1` (`make test` also runs `notcurses-tester`, but
hides important output).

To watch the bitchin' demo, run `./notcurses-demo -p ../data`. More details can
be found on the `notcurses-demo(1)` man page.

## Use

A full API reference [is available](https://nick-black.com/notcurses/). Manual
pages ought have been installed along with notcurses.

A program wishing to use notcurses will need to link it, ideally using the
output of `pkg-config --libs notcurses`. It is advised to compile with the
output of `pkg-config --cflags notcurses`. If using CMake, a support file is
provided, and can be accessed as `notcurses`.

Before calling into notcurses—and usually as one of the first calls of the
program—be sure to call `setlocale(3)` with an appropriate UTF-8 `LC_ALL`
locale. It is usually appropriate to use `setlocale(LC_ALL, "")`, relying on
the user to properly set the `LANG` environment variable. notcurses will
refuse to start if `nl_langinfo(3)` doesn't indicate UTF-8. In addition, it is
wise to mask most signals early in the program, before any threads are spawned.
(this is particularly critical for `SIGWINCH`).

notcurses requires an available `terminfo(5)` definition appropriate for the
terminal. It is usually appropriate to pass `NULL` in the `termtype` field of a
`notcurses_options` struct, relying on the user to properly set the `TERM`
environment variable. This variable is usually set by the terminal itself. It
might be necessary to manually select a higher-quality definition for your
terminal, i.e. `xterm-direct` as opposed to `xterm` or `xterm-256color`.

Each terminal can be prepared via a call to `notcurses_init()`, which is
supplied a struct of type `notcurses_options`:

```c
// Get a human-readable string describing the running notcurses version.
const char* notcurses_version(void);

struct cell;      // a coordinate on an ncplane: an EGC plus styling
struct ncplane;   // a drawable notcurses surface, composed of cells
struct notcurses; // notcurses state for a given terminal, composed of ncplanes

// These log levels consciously map cleanly to those of libav; notcurses itself
// does not use this full granularity. The log level does not affect the opening
// and closing banners, which can be disabled via the notcurses_option struct's
// 'suppress_banner'. Note that if stderr is connected to the same terminal on
// which we're rendering, any kind of logging will disrupt the output.
typedef enum {
  NCLOGLEVEL_SILENT,  // default. print nothing once fullscreen service begins
  NCLOGLEVEL_PANIC,   // print diagnostics immediately related to crashing
  NCLOGLEVEL_FATAL,   // we're hanging around, but we've had a horrible fault
  NCLOGLEVEL_ERROR,   // we can't keep doin' this, but we can do other things
  NCLOGLEVEL_WARNING, // you probably don't want what's happening to happen
  NCLOGLEVEL_INFO,    // "standard information"
  NCLOGLEVEL_VERBOSE, // "detailed information"
  NCLOGLEVEL_DEBUG,   // this is honestly a bit much
  NCLOGLEVEL_TRACE,   // there's probably a better way to do what you want
} ncloglevel_e;

// Configuration for notcurses_init().
typedef struct notcurses_options {
  // The name of the terminfo database entry describing this terminal. If NULL,
  // the environment variable TERM is used. Failure to open the terminal
  // definition will result in failure to initialize notcurses.
  const char* termtype;
  // If smcup/rmcup capabilities are indicated, notcurses defaults to making
  // use of the "alternate screen". This flag inhibits use of smcup/rmcup.
  bool inhibit_alternate_screen;
  // By default, we hide the cursor if possible. This flag inhibits use of
  // the civis capability, retaining the cursor.
  bool retain_cursor;
  // We typically install a signal handler for SIGINT and SIGQUIT that restores
  // the screen, and then calls the old signal handler. Set this to inhibit
  // registration of any signal handlers.
  bool no_quit_sighandlers;
  // We typically install a signal handler for SIGWINCH that generates a resize
  // event in the notcurses_getc() queue. Set this to inhibit the handler.
  bool no_winch_sighandler;
  // Notcurses typically prints version info in notcurses_init() and
  // performance info in notcurses_stop(). This inhibits that output.
  bool suppress_banner;
  // If non-NULL, notcurses_render() will write each rendered frame to this
  // FILE* in addition to outfp. This is used primarily for debugging.
  FILE* renderfp;
  // Progressively higher log levels result in more logging to stderr. By
  // default, nothing is printed to stderr once fullscreen service begins.
  ncloglevel_e loglevel;
} notcurses_options;

// Initialize a notcurses context on the connected terminal at 'fp'. 'fp' must
// be a tty. You'll usually want stdout. Returns NULL on error, including any
// failure initializing terminfo.
struct notcurses* notcurses_init(const notcurses_options* opts, FILE* fp);

// Destroy a notcurses context.
int notcurses_stop(struct notcurses* nc);
```

`notcurses_stop` should be called before exiting your program to restore the
terminal settings and free resources.

notcurses does not typically generate diagnostics (aside from the intro banner
and outro performance summary). When `stderr` is connected to the same terminal
to which graphics are being printed, printing to stderr will corrupt the output.
Setting `loglevel` to a value higher than `NCLOGLEVEL_SILENT` will cause
diagnostics to be printed to `stderr`: you could ensure `stderr` is redirected
if you make use of this functionality.

It's probably wise to export `inhibit_alternate_screen` to the user (e.g. via
command line option or environment variable). Developers and motivated users
might appreciate the ability to manipulate `loglevel` and `renderfp`. The
remaining options are typically of use only to application authors.

The notcurses API draws almost entirely into the virtual buffers of `ncplane`s.
Only upon a call to `notcurses_render` will the visible terminal display be
updated to reflect the changes:

```c
// Make the physical screen match the virtual screen. Changes made to the
// virtual screen (i.e. most other calls) will not be visible until after a
// successful call to notcurses_render().
int notcurses_render(struct notcurses* nc);

// Retrieve the contents of the specified cell as last rendered. The EGC is
// returned, or NULL on error. This EGC must be free()d by the caller. The cell
// 'c' is not bound to a plane, and thus its gcluster value must not be used--
// use the return value only.
char* notcurses_at_yx(struct notcurses* nc, int yoff, int xoff, cell* c);
```

One `ncplane` is guaranteed to exist: the "standard plane". The user cannot
move, resize, reparent, or destroy the standard plane (it *can* be erased).
Its dimensions always match notcurses's conception of the visible terminal. A
handle on the standard plane can be acquired with two top-level functions:

```c
// Get a reference to the standard plane (one matching our current idea of the
// terminal size) for this terminal. The standard plane always exists, and its
// origin is always at the uppermost, leftmost cell of the screen.
struct ncplane* notcurses_stdplane(struct notcurses* nc);
const struct ncplane* notcurses_stdplane_const(const struct notcurses* nc);
```

A reference to the standard plane *is* persistent across a screen resize, as are
any indexes into its egcpool, but its framebuffer *is not* necessarily
persistent across a screen resize. Thankfully, you shouldn't have a reference
to its framebuffer, and thus only the change to its dimensions can really catch
you off guard.

Utility functions operating on the toplevel `notcurses` object include:

```c
// Return the topmost ncplane, of which there is always at least one.
struct ncplane* notcurses_top(struct notcurses* n);

// Refresh our idea of the terminal's dimensions, reshaping the standard plane
// if necessary. Without a call to this function following a terminal resize
// (as signaled via SIGWINCH), notcurses_render() might not function properly.
// References to ncplanes (and the egcpools underlying cells) remain valid
// following a resize operation, but the cursor might have changed position.
int notcurses_resize(struct notcurses* n, int* RESTRICT y, int* RESTRICT x);

// Return our current idea of the terminal dimensions in rows and cols.
static inline void
notcurses_term_dim_yx(const struct notcurses* n, int* RESTRICT rows,
                      int* RESTRICT cols){
  ncplane_dim_yx(notcurses_stdplane_const(n), rows, cols);
}

// Refresh the physical screen to match what was last rendered (i.e., without
// reflecting any changes since the last call to notcurses_render()). This is
// primarily useful if the screen is externally corrupted.
int notcurses_refresh(struct notcurses* n);

// Returns a 16-bit bitmask in the LSBs of supported curses-style attributes
// (NCSTYLE_UNDERLINE, NCSTYLE_BOLD, etc.) The attribute is only
// indicated as supported if the terminal can support it together with color.
// For more information, see the "ncv" capability in terminfo(5).
unsigned notcurses_supported_styles(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Returns the number of simultaneous colors claimed to be supported, or 1 if
// there is no color support. Note that several terminal emulators advertise
// more colors than they actually support, downsampling internally.
int notcurses_palette_size(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we fade? Fading requires either the "rgb" or "ccc" terminfo capability.
bool notcurses_canfade(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we load images/videos? This requires being built against FFmpeg.
bool notcurses_canopen(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we change colors in the hardware palette? Requires "ccc" and "initc".
bool notcurses_canchangecolors(const struct notcurses* nc);
```

### Direct mode

"Direct mode" makes a limited subset of notcurses is available for manipulating
typical scrolling or file-backed output. These functions output directly and
immediately to the provided `FILE*`, and `notcurses_render()` is neither
supported nor necessary for such an instance. Use `notcurses_directmode()` to
create a direct mode context:

```c
struct ncdirect; // minimal state for a terminal

// Initialize a direct-mode notcurses context on the connected terminal at 'fp'.
// 'fp' must be a tty. You'll usually want stdout. Direct mode supportes a
// limited subset of notcurses routines which directly affect 'fp', and neither
// supports nor requires notcurses_render(). This can be used to add color and
// styling to text in the standard output paradigm. Returns NULL on error,
// including any failure initializing terminfo.
struct ncdirect* notcurses_directmode(const char* termtype, FILE* fp);

int ncdirect_stop(struct ncdirect* nc);
```

This context must be destroyed using `ncdirect_stop()`. The following functions
are available for direct mode:

```c
int ncdirect_bg_rgb8(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned r, unsigned g, unsigned b);
int ncdirect_fg_rgb8(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned r, unsigned g, unsigned b);
int ncdirect_fg(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned rgb);
int ncdirect_bg(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned rgb);
int ncdirect_dim_x(const struct ncdirect* nc);
int ncdirect_dim_y(const struct ncdirect* nc);
int ncdirect_styles_set(struct ncdirect* n, unsigned stylebits);
int ncdirect_styles_on(struct ncdirect* n, unsigned stylebits);
int ncdirect_styles_off(struct ncdirect* n, unsigned stylebits);
```

### Alignment

Most functions that generate output can be aligned relative to an ncplane.
Alignment currently comes in three forms: `NCALIGN_LEFT`, `NCALIGN_CENTER`, and
`NCALIGN_RIGHT`.

```c
// Alignment within the ncplane. Left/right-justified, or centered.
typedef enum {
  NCALIGN_LEFT,
  NCALIGN_CENTER,
  NCALIGN_RIGHT,
} ncalign_e;

// Return the column at which 'c' cols ought start in order to be aligned
// according to 'align' within ncplane 'n'. Returns INT_MAX on invalid 'align'.
// Undefined behavior on negative 'c'.
static inline int
ncplane_align(struct ncplane* n, ncalign_e align, int c){
  if(align == NCALIGN_LEFT){
    return 0;
  }
  int cols;
  ncplane_dim_yx(n, NULL, &cols);
  if(align == NCALIGN_CENTER){
    return (cols - c) / 2;
  }else if(align == NCALIGN_RIGHT){
    return cols - c;
  }
  return INT_MAX;
}
```

### Input

Input can currently be taken only from `stdin`, but on the plus side, stdin
needn't be a terminal device (unlike the ttyfp `FILE*` passed to `notcurses_init()`).
Generalized input ought happen soon. There is only one input queue per `struct
notcurses`.

Like NCURSES, notcurses will watch for escape sequences, check them against the
terminfo database, and return them as special keys (we hijack the Private Use
Area for special keys, specifically Supplementary Private Use Area B (u100000
through u10ffffd). Unlike NCURSES, the fundamental unit of input is the
UTF8-encoded Unicode codepoint. Note, however, that only one codepoint is
returned at a time (as opposed to an entire EGC).

It is generally possible for a false positive to occur, wherein keypresses
intended to be distinct are combined into an escape sequence. False negatives
where an intended escape sequence are read as an ESC key followed by distinct
keystrokes are also possible. NCURSES provides the `ESCDELAY` variable to
control timing. notcurses brooks no delay; all characters of an escape sequence
must be readable without delay for it to be interpreted as such.

```c
// All input is currently taken from stdin, though this will likely change. We
// attempt to read a single UTF8-encoded Unicode codepoint, *not* an entire
// Extended Grapheme Cluster. It is also possible that we will read a special
// keypress, i.e. anything that doesn't correspond to a Unicode codepoint (e.g.
// arrow keys, function keys, screen resize events, etc.). These are mapped
// into Unicode's Supplementary Private Use Area-B, starting at U+100000.
//
// notcurses_getc() and notcurses_getc_nblock() are both nonblocking.
// notcurses_getc_blocking() blocks until a codepoint or special key is read,
// or until interrupted by a signal.
//
// In the case of a valid read, a 32-bit Unicode codepoint is returned. 0 is
// returned to indicate that no input was available, but only by
// notcurses_getc(). Otherwise (including on EOF) (char32_t)-1 is returned.

### Mice

notcurses supports mice, though only through brokers such as X or
[GPM](https://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/gpm/). It does not speak
directly to hardware. Mouse events must be explicitly enabled with a
successful call to `notcurses_mouse_enable()`, and can later be disabled.

```c
// Enable the mouse in "button-event tracking" mode with focus detection and
// UTF8-style extended coordinates. On failure, -1 is returned. On success, 0
// is returned, and mouse events will be published to notcurses_getc().
int notcurses_mouse_enable(struct notcurses* n);

// Disable mouse events. Any events in the input queue can still be delivered.
int notcurses_mouse_disable(struct notcurses* n);
```

"Button-event tracking mode" implies the ability to detect mouse button
presses, and also mouse movement while holding down a mouse button (i.e. to
effect drag-and-drop). Mouse events are returned via the `NCKEY_MOUSE*` values,
with coordinate information in the `ncinput` struct.

### Planes

Fundamental to notcurses is a z-buffer of rectilinear virtual screens, known
as `ncplane`s. An `ncplane` can be larger than the physical screen, or smaller,
or the same size; it can be entirely contained within the physical screen, or
overlap in part, or lie wholly beyond the boundaries, never to be rendered.
In addition to its framebuffer--a rectilinear matrix of cells
(see [Cells](#cells))--an `ncplane` is defined by:

* a base cell, used for any cell on the plane without a glyph,
* the egcpool backing its cells,
* a current cursor location,
* a current style, foreground channel, and background channel,
* its geometry,
* a configured user curry (a `void*`),
* its position relative to the visible plane, and
* its z-index.

If opaque, a `cell` on a higher `ncplane` completely obstructs a corresponding
`cell` from a lower `ncplane` from being seen. An `ncplane` corresponds loosely
to an [NCURSES Panel](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-intro.html#panels),
but is the primary drawing surface of notcurses—there is no object
corresponding to a bare NCURSES `WINDOW`.

In addition to `ncplane_new()`, an `ncplane` can be created aligned relative
to an existing `ncplane` (including the standard plane) using `ncplane_aligned()`.
When an `ncplane` is no longer needed, free it with `ncplane_destroy()`. To
quickly reset the `ncplane`, use `ncplane_erase()`.

```c
// Create a new ncplane at the specified offset (relative to the standard plane)
// and the specified size. The number of rows and columns must both be positive.
// This plane is initially at the top of the z-buffer, as if ncplane_move_top()
// had been called on it. The void* 'opaque' can be retrieved (and reset) later.
struct ncplane* ncplane_new(struct notcurses* nc, int rows, int cols,
                            int yoff, int xoff, void* opaque);

// Create a new ncplane aligned relative to 'n'.
struct ncplane* ncplane_aligned(struct ncplane* n, int rows, int cols,
                                int yoff, ncalign_e align, void* opaque);

// Duplicate an existing ncplane. The new plane will have the same geometry,
// will duplicate all content, and will start with the same rendering state.
// The new plane will be immediately above the old one on the z axis.
struct ncplane* ncplane_dup(struct ncplane* n, void* opaque);

// Destroy the specified ncplane. None of its contents will be visible after
// the next call to notcurses_render(). It is an error to attempt to destroy
// the standard plane.
int ncplane_destroy(struct ncplane* ncp);

// Erase every cell in the ncplane, resetting all attributes to normal, all
// colors to the default color, and all cells to undrawn. All cells associated
// with this ncplane are invalidated, and must not be used after the call,
// excluding the base cell.
void ncplane_erase(struct ncplane* n);
```

Planes can be freely resized, though they must retain a positive size in
both dimensions. The powerful `ncplane_resize()` allows resizing an `ncplane`,
retaining all or a portion of the plane's existing content, and translating
the plane in one step. The helper function `ncplane_resize_simple()` allows
resizing an `ncplane` without movement, retaining all possible data. To move
the plane without resizing it or changing its content, use `ncplane_move_yx()`.
It is an error to invoke these functions on the standard plane.

```c
// Resize the specified ncplane. The four parameters 'keepy', 'keepx',
// 'keepleny', and 'keeplenx' define a subset of the ncplane to keep,
// unchanged. This may be a section of size 0, though none of these four
// parameters may be negative. 'keepx' and 'keepy' are relative to the ncplane.
// They must specify a coordinate within the ncplane's totality. 'yoff' and
// 'xoff' are relative to 'keepy' and 'keepx', and place the upper-left corner
// of the resized ncplane. Finally, 'ylen' and 'xlen' are the dimensions of the
// ncplane after resizing. 'ylen' must be greater than or equal to 'keepleny',
// and 'xlen' must be greater than or equal to 'keeplenx'. It is an error to
// attempt to resize the standard plane. If either of 'keepleny' or 'keeplenx'
// is non-zero, both must be non-zero.
//
// Essentially, the kept material does not move. It serves to anchor the
// resized plane. If there is no kept material, the plane can move freely.
int ncplane_resize(struct ncplane* n, int keepy, int keepx, int keepleny,
                       int keeplenx, int yoff, int xoff, int ylen, int xlen);

// Resize the plane, retaining what data we can (everything, unless we're
// shrinking in some dimension). Keep the origin where it is.
static inline int
ncplane_resize_simple(struct ncplane* n, int ylen, int xlen){
  int oldy, oldx;
  ncplane_dim_yx(n, &oldy, &oldx); // current dimensions of 'n'
  int keepleny = oldy > ylen ? ylen : oldy;
  int keeplenx = oldx > xlen ? xlen : oldx;
  return ncplane_resize(n, 0, 0, keepleny, keeplenx, 0, 0, ylen, xlen);
}

// Move this plane relative to the standard plane. It is an error to attempt to
// move the standard plane.
int ncplane_move_yx(struct ncplane* n, int y, int x);

// Get the origin of this ncplane relative to the standard plane.
void ncplane_yx(struct ncplane* n, int* RESTRICT y, int* RESTRICT x);

// Return the dimensions of this ncplane.
void ncplane_dim_yx(struct ncplane* n, int* RESTRICT rows, int* RESTRICT cols);

static inline int
ncplane_dim_y(struct ncplane* n){
  int dimy;
  ncplane_dim_yx(n, &dimy, NULL);
  return dimy;
}

static inline int
ncplane_dim_x(struct ncplane* n){
  int dimx;
  ncplane_dim_yx(n, NULL, &dimx);
  return dimx;
}
```

If a given cell's glyph is zero, or its foreground channel is fully transparent,
it is considered to have no foreground. A _default_ cell can be chosen for the
`ncplane`, to be consulted in this case. If the base cell's glyph is likewise
zero (or its foreground channel fully transparent), the plane's foreground is
not rendered. Note that the base cell, like every other cell, has its own
foreground and background channels.

```c
// Set the specified style bits for the ncplane 'n', whether they're actively
// supported or not.
void ncplane_styles_set(struct ncplane* n, unsigned stylebits);

// Add the specified styles to the ncplane's existing spec.
void ncplane_styles_on(struct ncplane* n, unsigned stylebits);

// Remove the specified styles from the ncplane's existing spec.
void ncplane_styles_off(struct ncplane* n, unsigned stylebits);

// Return the current styling for this ncplane.
unsigned ncplane_styles(struct ncplane* n);

// Set the ncplane's base cell to this cell. It will be used for purposes of
// rendering anywhere that the ncplane's gcluster is 0. Erasing the ncplane
// does not reset the base cell; this function must be called with a zero 'c'.
int ncplane_set_base_cell(struct ncplane* ncp, const cell* c);

// Set the ncplane's base cell to this cell. It will be used for purposes of
// rendering anywhere that the ncplane's gcluster is 0. Erasing the ncplane
// does not reset the base cell; this function must be called with an empty
// 'egc'. 'egc' must be a single extended grapheme cluster.
int ncplane_set_base(struct ncplane* ncp, uint64_t channels,
                     uint32_t attrword, const char* egc);

// Extract the ncplane's base cell into 'c'. The reference is invalidated if
// 'ncp' is destroyed.
int ncplane_base(struct ncplane* ncp, cell* c);
```

`ncplane`s are completely ordered along an imaginary z-axis. Newly-created
`ncplane`s are on the top of the stack. They can be freely reordered.

```c
// Splice ncplane 'n' out of the z-buffer, and reinsert it at the top or bottom.
int ncplane_move_top(struct ncplane* n);
int ncplane_move_bottom(struct ncplane* n);

// Splice ncplane 'n' out of the z-buffer, and reinsert it below 'below'.
int ncplane_move_below(struct ncplane* RESTRICT n, struct ncplane* RESTRICT below);

// Splice ncplane 'n' out of the z-buffer, and reinsert it above 'above'.
int ncplane_move_above(struct ncplane* RESTRICT n, struct ncplane* RESTRICT above);

// Return the ncplane below this one, or NULL if this is at the stack's bottom.
struct ncplane* ncplane_below(struct ncplane* n);
```

Each plane holds a user pointer which can be retrieved and set (or ignored). In
addition, the plane's virtual framebuffer can be accessed (note that this does
not necessarily reflect anything on the actual screen).

```c
// Retrieve the cell at the cursor location on the specified plane, returning
// it in 'c'. This copy is safe to use until the ncplane is destroyed/erased.
int ncplane_at_cursor(struct ncplane* n, cell* c);

// Retrieve the cell at the specified location on the specified plane, returning
// it in 'c'. This copy is safe to use until the ncplane is destroyed/erased.
int ncplane_at_yx(struct ncplane* n, int y, int x, cell* c);

// Manipulate the opaque user pointer associated with this plane.
// ncplane_set_userptr() returns the previous userptr after replacing
// it with 'opaque'. the others simply return the userptr.
void* ncplane_set_userptr(struct ncplane* n, void* opaque);
void* ncplane_userptr(struct ncplane* n);
const void* ncplane_userptr_const(const struct ncplane* n);
```

All output is to `ncplane`s. There is no cost in moving the cursor around the
virtual framebuffer. Output that's never rendered still has some memory transfer
cost as the virtual framebuffer is prepared, but new data overwrites it in
memory.

```c
// Move the cursor to the specified position (the cursor needn't be visible).
// Returns -1 on error, including negative parameters, or ones exceeding the
// plane's dimensions.
int ncplane_cursor_move_yx(struct ncplane* n, int y, int x);

// Get the current position of the cursor within n. y and/or x may be NULL.

// planes is limited, and affected by the complexity of the rest of the screen).
// It is not safe to resize or destroy the plane during the fadeout FIXME.
int ncplane_fadeout(struct ncplane* n, const struct timespec* ts, fadecb fader, void* curry);

// Fade the ncplane in over the specified time. Load the ncplane with the
// target cells without rendering, then call this function. When it's done, the

int ncplane_fadein(struct ncplane* n, const struct timespec* ts, fadecb fader, void* curry);

// Pulse the plane in and out until the callback returns non-zero, relying on
// the callback 'fader' to initiate rendering. 'ts' defines the half-period

// ncplane_pulse(), which will fade in from black to the specified colors.
int ncplane_pulse(struct ncplane* n, const struct timespec* ts, fadecb fader, void* curry);
```

Finally, a raw stream of RGBA or BGRx data can be blitted directly to an ncplane:

```c
// Blit a flat array 'data' of BGRx 32-bit values to the ncplane 'nc', offset
// from the upper left by 'placey' and 'placex'. Each row ought occupy
// 'linesize' bytes (this might be greater than lenx * 4 due to padding). A
// subregion of the input can be specified with 'begy'x'begx' and 'leny'x'lenx'.
int ncblit_bgrx(struct ncplane* nc, int placey, int placex, int linesize,
                const unsigned char* data, int begy, int begx,
                int leny, int lenx);

// Blit a flat array 'data' of RGBA 32-bit values to the ncplane 'nc', offset
// from the upper left by 'placey' and 'placex'. Each row ought occupy
// 'linesize' bytes (this might be greater than lenx * 4 due to padding). A
// subregion of the input can be specified with 'begy'x'begx' and 'leny'x'lenx'.
int ncblit_rgba(struct ncplane* nc, int placey, int placex, int linesize,
                const unsigned char* data, int begy, int begx,
                int leny, int lenx);
```

#### Plane channels API

Helpers are provided to manipulate an `ncplane`'s `channels` member. They are
all implemented in terms of the lower-level [Channels API](#channels).

```c
// Get the current channels or attribute word for ncplane 'n'.
uint64_t ncplane_channels(const struct ncplane* n);
uint32_t ncplane_attr(const struct ncplane* n);

// Extract the 32-bit working background channel from an ncplane.
static inline unsigned
ncplane_bchannel(const struct ncplane* nc){
  return channels_bchannel(ncplane_channels(nc));
}

// Extract the 32-bit working foreground channel from an ncplane.
static inline unsigned

  return channels_fchannel(ncplane_channels(nc));
}

// Extract 24 bits of working foreground RGB from an ncplane, shifted to LSBs.

}

// Set the alpha parameters for ncplane 'n'.
int ncplane_set_fg_alpha(struct ncplane* n, int alpha);
int ncplane_set_bg_alpha(struct ncplane* n, int alpha);

// Extract 24 bits of foreground RGB from 'n', split into subcomponents.
static inline unsigned
ncplane_fg_rgb(const struct ncplane* n, unsigned* r, unsigned* g, unsigned*
  return channels_fg_rgb(ncplane_channels(n), r, g, b);
}

// Extract 24 bits of background RGB from 'n', split into subcomponents.
static inline unsigned
ncplane_bg_rgb(const struct ncplane* n, unsigned* r, unsigned* g, unsigned*
  return channels_bg_rgb(ncplane_channels(n), r, g, b);
}

// Set the current fore/background color using RGB specifications. If the
// terminal does not support directly-specified 3x8b cells (24-bit "Direct
// Color", indicated by the "RGB" terminfo capability), the provided values
// will be interpreted in some lossy fashion. None of r, g, or b may exceed 255.
// "HP-like" terminals require setting foreground and background at the same

// Same, but clipped to [0..255].
void ncplane_set_bg_rgb_clipped(struct ncplane* n, int r, int g, int b);
void ncplane_set_fg_rgb_clipped(struct ncplane* n, int r, int g, int b);

// Same, but with rgb assembled into a channel (i.e. lower 24 bits).
int ncplane_set_fg(struct ncplane* n, unsigned channel);
int ncplane_set_bg(struct ncplane* n, unsigned channel);

// Use the default color for the foreground/background.
void ncplane_set_fg_default(struct ncplane* n);
void ncplane_set_bg_default(struct ncplane* n);

int ncplane_set_fg_palindex(struct ncplane* n, int idx);
int ncplane_set_bg_palindex(struct ncplane* n, int idx);
```

#### Wide chars

Notcurses assumes that all glyphs occupy widths which are an integral multiple
of the smallest possible glyph's cell width (aka a "fixed-width font"). Unicode
introduces characters which generally occupy two such cells, known as wide
characters (though in the end, width of a glyph is a property of the font). It
is not possible to print half of such a glyph, nor is it generally possible to
print a wide glyph on the last column of a terminal.

Notcurses does not consider it an error to place a wide character on the last
column of a line. It will obliterate any content which was in that cell, but
will not itself be rendered. The default content will not be reproduced in such
a cell, either. When any character is placed atop a wide character's left or
right half, the wide character is obliterated in its entirety. When a wide
character is placed, any character under its left or right side is annihilated,
including wide characters. It is thus possible for two wide characters to sit
at columns 0 and 2, and for both to be obliterated by a single wide character
placed at column 1.

Likewise, when rendering, a plane which would partially obstruct a wide glyph
prevents it from being rendered entirely. A pathological case would be that of
a terminal _n_ columns in width, containing _n-1_ planes, each 2 columns wide.
The planes are placed at offsets [0..n - 2]. Each plane is above the plane to
its left, and each plane contains a single wide character. Were this to be
rendered, only the rightmost plane (and its single glyph) would be rendered!

```c
// Calculate the size in columns of the provided UTF8 multibyte string.
int mbswidth(const char* mbs);
```

### Cells

Unlike the `notcurses` or `ncplane` objects, the definition of `cell` is
available to the user. It is somewhat ironic, then, that the user typically
needn't (and shouldn't) use `cell`s directly. Use a `cell` when the EGC being
output is used several times. In this case, time otherwise spent running
`cell_load()` (which tokenizes and verifies EGCs) can be saved. It can also be
useful to use a `cell` when the same styling is used in a discontinuous manner.

```c
// A cell corresponds to a single character cell on some plane, which can be
// occupied by a single grapheme cluster (some root spacing glyph, along with
// possible combining characters, which might span multiple columns). At any
// cell, we can have a theoretically arbitrarily long UTF-8 string, a foreground
// color, a background color, and an attribute set. Valid grapheme cluster
// contents include:
//
//  * A NUL terminator,
//  * A single control character, followed by a NUL terminator,
//  * At most one spacing character, followed by zero or more nonspacing
//    characters, followed by a NUL terminator.
//
// Multi-column characters can only have a single style/color throughout.
//
// Each cell occupies 16 static bytes (128 bits). The surface is thus ~1.6MB
// for a (pretty large) 500x200 terminal. At 80x43, it's less than 64KB.
// Dynamic requirements can add up to 16MB to an ncplane, but such large pools
// are unlikely in common use.
//
// We implement some small alpha compositing. Foreground and background both
// have two bits of inverted alpha. The actual grapheme written to a cell is
// the topmost non-zero grapheme. If its alpha is 00, its foreground color is
// used unchanged. If its alpha is 10, its foreground color is derived entirely
// from cells underneath it. Otherwise, the result will be a composite.
// Likewise for the background. If the bottom of a coordinate's zbuffer is
// reached with a cumulative alpha of zero, the default is used. In this way,
// a terminal configured with transparent background can be supported through
// multiple occluding ncplanes. A foreground alpha of 11 requests high-contrast
// text (relative to the computed background). A background alpha of 11 is
// currently forbidden.
//
// Default color takes precedence over palette or RGB, and cannot be used with
// transparency. Indexed palette takes precedence over RGB. It cannot
// meaningfully set transparency, but it can be mixed into a cascading color.
// RGB is used if neither default terminal colors nor palette indexing are in
// play, and fully supports all transparency options.
typedef struct cell {
  // These 32 bits are either a single-byte, single-character grapheme cluster
  // (values 0--0x7f), or an offset into a per-ncplane attached pool of
  // varying-length UTF-8 grapheme clusters. This pool may thus be up to 32MB.
  uint32_t gcluster;          // 4B -> 4B
  // NCSTYLE_* attributes (16 bits) + 8 foreground palette index bits + 8
  // background palette index bits. palette index bits are used only if the
  // corresponding default color bit *is not* set, and the corresponding
  // palette index bit *is* set.
  uint32_t attrword;          // + 4B -> 8B
  // (channels & 0x8000000000000000ull): left half of wide character
  // (channels & 0x4000000000000000ull): foreground is *not* "default color"
  // (channels & 0x3000000000000000ull): foreground alpha (2 bits)
  // (channels & 0x0800000000000000ull): foreground uses palette index
  // (channels & 0x0700000000000000ull): reserved, must be 0
  // (channels & 0x00ffffff00000000ull): foreground in 3x8 RGB (rrggbb)
  // (channels & 0x0000000080000000ull): right half of wide character
  // (channels & 0x0000000040000000ull): background is *not* "default color"
  // (channels & 0x0000000030000000ull): background alpha (2 bits)

  // At render time, these 24-bit values are quantized down to terminal
  // capabilities, if necessary. There's a clear path to 10-bit support should
  // we one day need it, but keep things cagey for now. "default color" is
  // best explained by color(3NCURSES). ours is the same concept. until the
  // "not default color" bit is set, any color you load will be ignored.
  uint64_t channels;          // + 8B == 16B

```

`cell`s must be initialized with an initialization macro or `cell_init()`
before any other use. `cell_init()` and `CELL_TRIVIAL_INITIALIZER` both
simply zero out the `cell`.

```c
#define CELL_TRIVIAL_INITIALIZER { .gcluster = '\0', .attrword = 0, .channels = 0, }
#define CELL_SIMPLE_INITIALIZER(c) { .gcluster = (c), .attrword = 0, .channels = 0, }
#define CELL_INITIALIZER(c, a, chan) { .gcluster = (c), .attrword = (a), .channels = (chan), }

static inline void
cell_init(cell* c){
  memset(c, 0, sizeof(*c));
}
```

A `cell` has three fundamental elements:

* The EGC displayed at this coordinate, encoded in UTF-8. If the EGC is a
  single ASCII character (value less than 0x80), it is stored inline in
  the `cell`'s `gcluster` field. Otherwise, `gcluster`'s top 24 bits
  are a 128-biased offset into the associated `ncplane`'s egcpool. This
  implies that `cell`s are associated with `ncplane`s once prepared.
* The Curses-style attributes of the text.
* The 52 bits of foreground and background RGBA (2x8/8/8/2), plus a few flags.

The EGC should be loaded using `cell_load()`. Either a single NUL-terminated
EGC can be provided, or a string composed of multiple EGCs. In the latter case,
the first EGC from the string is loaded. Remember, backing storage for the EGC
is provided by the `ncplane` passed to `cell_load()`; if this `ncplane` is
destroyed (or even erased), the `cell` cannot safely be used. If you're done
using the `cell` before being done with the `ncplane`, call `cell_release()`
to free up the EGC resources.

```c
// Breaks the UTF-8 string in 'gcluster' down, setting up the cell 'c'. Returns
// the number of bytes copied out of 'gcluster', or -1 on failure. The styling
// of the cell is left untouched, but any resources are released.

### Multimedia

Media decoding and scaling is handled by libAV from FFmpeg, resulting in a
`notcurses_visual` object. This object generates frames, each one corresponding
to a renderable scene on the associated `ncplane`. If notcurses is built without
FFMpeg support, these functions will all return error.

```c
// Open a visual (image or video), associating it with the specified ncplane.
// Returns NULL on any error, writing the AVError to 'averr'.

// How to scale the visual in ncvisual_open_plane(). NCSCALE_NONE will open a
// plane tailored to the visual's exact needs, which is probably larger than the

// stretches and scales the image in an attempt to fill the visible screen.

### Reels

ncreels are a complex UI abstraction offered by notcurses, derived from my
similar work in [outcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/ncreels#ncreels).

The ncreel is a UI abstraction supported by notcurses in which
dynamically-created and -destroyed toplevel entities (referred to as tablets)
are arranged in a torus (circular loop), allowing for infinite scrolling
(infinite scrolling can be disabled, resulting in a line segment rather than a
torus). This works naturally with keyboard navigation, mouse scrolling wheels,
and touchpads (including the capacitive touchscreens of modern cell phones).
The "panel" comes from the underlying ncurses objects (each entity corresponds
to a single panel) and the "reel" from slot machines. An ncreel initially has
no tablets; at any given time thereafter, it has zero or more tablets, and if
there is at least one tablet, one tablet is focused (and on-screen). If the
last tablet is removed, no tablet is focused. A tablet can support navigation
within the tablet, in which case there is an in-tablet focus for the focused
tablet, which can also move among elements within the tablet.

The ncreel object tracks the size of the screen, the size, number,
information depth, and order of tablets, and the focuses. It also draws the
optional borders around tablets and the optional border of the reel itself. It
knows nothing about the actual content of a tablet, save the number of lines it
occupies at each information depth. The typical control flow is that an
application receives events (from the UI or other event sources), and calls
into notcurses saying e.g. "Tablet 2 now has 40 valid lines of information".
notcurses might then call back into the application, asking it to draw some
line(s) from some tablet(s) at some particular coordinate of that tablet's
panel. Finally, control returns to the application, and the cycle starts anew.

Each tablet might be wholly, partially, or not on-screen. notcurses always
places as much of the focused tablet as is possible on-screen (if the focused
tablet has more lines than the actual reel does, it cannot be wholly on-screen.
In this case, the focused subelements of the tablet are always on-screen). The
placement of the focused tablet depends on how it was reached (when moving to
the next tablet, offscreen tablets are brought onscreen at the bottom. When
moving to the previous tablet, offscreen tablets are brought onscreen at the
top. When moving to an arbitrary tablet which is neither the next nor previous
tablet, it will be placed in the center).

The controlling application can, at any time,

* Insert a new tablet somewhere in the reel (possibly off-screen)
* Delete a (possibly off-screen) tablet from the reel
* Change focus to the next or previous tablet, bringing it on-screen if it is off
* Change focus to some arbitrary other tablet, bringing it on-screen if it is off
* Expand or collapse the information depth of a tablet
* Change the content of a tablet, updating it if it is on-screen
  * Remove content from a tablet, possibly resizing it, and possibly changing focus within the tablet
  * Add content to the tablet, possibly resizing it, and possibly creating focus within the tablet
* Navigate within the focused tablet
* Create or destroy new panels atop the ncreel
* Indicate that the screen has been resized or needs be redrawn

A special case arises when moving among the tablets of a reel having multiple
tablets, all of which fit entirely on-screen, and infinite scrolling is in use.
Normally, upon moving to the next tablet from the bottommost tablet, the
(offscreen) next tablet is pulled up into the bottom of the reel (the reverse
is true when moving to the previous tablet from the topmost). When all tablets
are onscreen with infinite scrolling, there are two possibilities: either the
focus scrolls (moving from the bottom tablet to the top tablet, for instance),
or the reel scrolls (preserving order among the tablets, but changing their
order on-screen). In this latter case, moving to the next tablet from the
bottommost tablet results in the tablet which is gaining focus being brought to
the bottom of the screen from the top, and all other tablets moving up on the
screen. Moving to the previous tablet from the topmost tablet results in the
bottommost tablet moving to the top of the screen, and all other tablets moving
down. This behavior matches the typical behavior precisely, and avoids a rude
UI discontinuity when the tablets grow to fill the entire screen (or shrink to
not fill it). If it is not desired, however, scrolling of focus can be
configured instead.

```c
// An ncreel is an notcurses region devoted to displaying zero or more
// line-oriented, contained panels between which the user may navigate. If at
// least one panel exists, there is an active panel. As much of the active
// panel as is possible is always displayed. If there is space left over, other
// panels are included in the display. Panels can come and go at any time, and
// can grow or shrink at any time.
//

// scrolling gestures, trackballs, scrollwheels, touchpads, and verbal commands.

#### ncreel examples

Let's say we have a screen of 11 lines, and 3 tablets of one line each. Both
a screen border and tablet borders are in use. The tablets are A, B, and C.
No gap is in use between tablets. Xs indicate focus. If B currently has focus,
and the next tablet is selected, the result would be something like:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   A   | |                         | |   A   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "next tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |   B   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |XX C XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

If instead the previous tablet had been selected, we would of course get:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   A   | |                         | |XX A XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "prev tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |   B   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |   C   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

If A instead has the focus, choosing the "next tablet" is trivial: the tablets
do not change, and focus shifts to B. If we choose the "previous tablet", there
are three possibilities:

* Finite scrolling: No change. The tablets stay in place. A remains focused.

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |XX A XX| |                         | |XX A XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "prev tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |   B   | |     (finite scroll)     | |   B   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |   C   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

* Infinite scrolling with rotation: Focus shifts to C, which moves to the top:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |XX A XX| |                         | |XX C XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "prev tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |   B   | |  (infinite scroll with  | |   A   | |
 | --------- |        rotation)        | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |   B   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

* Infinite scrolling with focus rotation: Focus shifts to C, and moves to the bottom:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |XX A XX| |                         | |   A   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "prev tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |   B   | |  (infinite scroll with  | |   B   | |
 | --------- |     focus rotation)     | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |XX C XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

Now imagine us to have the same 3 tablets, but each is now 4 lines. It is
impossible to have two of these tablets wholly onscreen at once, let alone all
three. If we started with A focused and at the top, the result after all three
tablets have grown will be:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- | A remains at the top, and
 | |XX A XX| |                         | |XXXXXXX| | is wholly on-screen. B is
 | --------- |                         | |XX A XX| | below it, but we can show
 | --------- | ---- "grow tablet" ---> | |XXXXXXX| | only the first two lines.
 | |   B   | |       A (focused)       | |XXXXXXX| | C has been pushed
 | --------- |                         | --------- | off-screen.
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |       | |
 | --------- |                         | |   B   | |
 -------------                         -------------
```

When a tablet is enlarged, it grows towards the nearest boundary, unless that
would result in the focused tablet being moved, in which case the growing
tablet instead grows in the other direction (if the tablet is in the middle
of the screen exactly, it grows down). There is one exception to this rule: if
the tablets are not making full use of the screen, growth is always down (the
screen is always filled from the top), even if it moves the focused tablet.

A 12-line screen has three tablets: A (2 lines), B (1 line), C (1 line), filling
the screen exactly. B is focused, and grows two lines:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- | B grows down, since it is
 | |   A   | |                         | |   A   | | closer to the bottom (3
 | |       | |                         | |       | | lines) than the top (4
 | --------- | ---- "grow tablet" ---> | --------- | lines). C is pushed almost
 | --------- |       B (focused)       | --------- | entirely off-screen. A is
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |XXXXXXX| | untouched.
 | --------- |                         | |XX B XX| |
 | --------- |                         | |XXXXXXX| |
 | |   C   | |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

Starting with the same situation, A grows by 2 lines instead:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | |       | | A grows up. It would have
 | |   A   | |                         | |   A   | | grown down, but that would
 | |       | |                         | |       | | have moved B, which has
 | --------- | ---- "grow tablet" ---> | --------- | the focus. B and C remain
 | --------- |     A (not focused)     | --------- | where they are; A moves
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |XX B XX| | partially off-screen.
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |   C   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

If we started with the same situation, and B grew by 7 lines, it would first
push C entirely off-screen (B would then have four lines of text), and then
push A off-screen. B would then have eight lines of text, the maximum on a
12-line screen with both types of borders.

### Selectors

The selector widget provides an ncplane with a title riser and a body section.
The body section is populated with options and descriptions, and supports
infinite scrolling up and down. The widgets looks like:

At all times, exactly one item is selected (unless there are no items). A
selector is created with `ncselector_create` and destroyed with
`ncselector_destroy`.

```c
struct selector_item {
  char* option;
  char* desc;
};

typedef struct selector_options {
  char* title; // title may be NULL, inhibiting riser, saving two rows.
  char* secondary; // secondary may be NULL
  char* footer; // footer may be NULL
  struct selector_item* items; // initial items and descriptions
  unsigned itemcount; // number of initial items and descriptions
  // default item (selected at start), must be < itemcount unless 'itemcount'
  // is 0, in which case 'defidx' must also be 0
  unsigned defidx;
  // maximum number of options to display at once, 0 to use all available space
  unsigned maxdisplay;
  // exhaustive styling options
  uint64_t opchannels;   // option channels
  uint64_t descchannels; // description channels
  uint64_t titlechannels;// title channels
  uint64_t footchannels; // secondary and footer channels
  uint64_t boxchannels;  // border channels
  uint64_t bgchannels;   // background channels, used only in body
} selector_options;

struct ncselector;

struct ncselector* ncselector_create(struct ncplane* n, int y, int x,
                                     const selector_options* opts);

int ncselector_additem(struct ncselector* n, const struct selector_item* item);
int ncselector_delitem(struct ncselector* n, const char* item);

// Return a copy of the currently-selected option. NULL if there are no items.
char* ncselector_selected(const struct ncselector* n);

struct ncplane* ncselector_plane(struct ncselector* n);

// Move up or down in the list. If 'newitem' is not NULL, the newly-selected
// option will be strdup()ed and assigned to '*newitem' (and must be free()d by
// the caller).
void ncselector_previtem(struct ncselector* n, char** newitem);
void ncselector_nextitem(struct ncselector* n, char** newitem);

// Destroy the ncselector. If 'item' is not NULL, the last selected option will
// be strdup()ed and assigned to '*item' (and must be free()d by the caller).
void ncselector_destroy(struct ncselector* n, char** item);
```

### Menus

Horizontal menu bars are supported, on the top or bottom rows of the screen
(menus are bound to a `notcurses` object, not particular `ncplane`s). If the
menu bar is longer than the screen, it will be only partially visible, but any
unrolled section will be visible. Menus may be either visible or invisible by
default; set the `hiding` option to get an invisible menu. In the event of a
screen resize, menus will be automatically moved/resized.

```c
typedef struct menu_options {
  bool bottom;              // on the bottom row, as opposed to top row
  bool hiding;              // hide the menu when not being used
  struct {
    char* name;             // utf-8 c string
    struct {
      char* desc;           // utf-8 menu item, NULL for horizontal separator
      ncinput shortcut;     // shortcut, all should be distinct
    }* items;
    int itemcount;
  }* sections;              // array of menu sections
  int sectioncount;         // must be positive
  uint64_t headerchannels;  // styling for header
  uint64_t sectionchannels; // styling for sections
} menu_options;

struct ncmenu;

// Create a menu with the specified options. Menus are currently bound to an
// overall notcurses object (as opposed to a particular plane), and are
// implemented as ncplanes kept atop other ncplanes.
struct ncmenu* ncmenu_create(struct notcurses* nc, const menu_options* opts);

// Unroll the specified menu section, making the menu visible if it was
// invisible, and rolling up any menu section that is already unrolled.
int ncmenu_unroll(struct ncmenu* n, int sectionidx);

// Roll up any unrolled menu section, and hide the menu if using hiding.
int ncmenu_rollup(struct ncmenu* n);

// Return the selected item description, or NULL if no section is unrolled.
const char* ncmenu_selected(const struct ncmenu* n);

// Destroy a menu created with ncmenu_create().
int ncmenu_destroy(struct notcurses* nc, struct ncmenu* n);
```

### Channels

A channel encodes 24 bits of RGB color, using 8 bits for each component. It
additionally provides 2 bits of alpha channel, a bit for selecting terminal
default colors, and a bit to indicate whether it describes a Wide East Asian
character. The remaining four bits are reserved. Typically two channels are
bound together in a 64-bit unsigned integer (`uint64_t`), with eight bits
currently going unused. There is such a double-channel in every `cell` and
`ncplane` object.

Usually, the higher-level `ncplane` and `cell` functionality ought be used. It
will sometimes be necessary, however, to muck with channels at their lowest
level. The channel API facilitates such muckery. All channel-related `ncplane`
and `cell` functionality is implemented in terms of this API.

```c
// Extract the 8-bit red component from a 32-bit channel.
static inline unsigned
channel_r(unsigned channel){
  return (channel & 0xff0000u) >> 16u;

### Perf

Rendering performance can be very roughly categorized as inversely proportional
to the product of:
* color changes across the rendered screen,
* planar depth before an opaque glyph and background are locked in,
* number of UTF-8 bytes composing the rendered glyphs, and
* screen geometry

notcurses tracks statistics across its operation, and a snapshot can be
acquired using the `notcurses_stats()` function. This function cannot fail.

```c
typedef struct ncstats {
  // purely increasing stats
  uint64_t renders;          // number of successful notcurses_render() runs
  uint64_t failed_renders;   // number of aborted renders, should be 0
  uint64_t render_bytes;     // bytes emitted to ttyfp
  int64_t render_max_bytes;  // max bytes emitted for a frame
  int64_t render_min_bytes;  // min bytes emitted for a frame
  uint64_t render_ns;        // nanoseconds spent in notcurses_render()
  int64_t render_max_ns;     // max ns spent in notcurses_render()
  int64_t render_min_ns;     // min ns spent in successful notcurses_render()
  uint64_t cellelisions;     // cells we elided entirely thanks to damage maps
  uint64_t cellemissions;    // cells we emitted due to inferred damage
  uint64_t fgelisions;       // RGB fg elision count
  uint64_t fgemissions;      // RGB fg emissions
  uint64_t bgelisions;       // RGB bg elision count
  uint64_t bgemissions;      // RGB bg emissions
  uint64_t defaultelisions;  // default color was emitted
  uint64_t defaultemissions; // default color was elided

  // current state -- these can decrease
  uint64_t fbbytes;          // total bytes devoted to all active framebuffers
  unsigned planes;           // number of planes currently in existence
} ncstats;

// Acquire an atomic snapshot of the notcurses object's stats.
void notcurses_stats(struct notcurses* nc, ncstats* stats);

// Reset all cumulative stats (immediate ones, such as fbbytes, are not reset).
void notcurses_reset_stats(struct notcurses* nc, ncstats* stats);
```

Timings for renderings are across the breadth of `notcurses_render()`: they
include all per-render preprocessing, output generation, and dumping of the
output (including any sleeping while waiting on the terminal).

The notcurses drawing algorithm logically starts by zeroing out a _solutions array_
of booleans. When this array is all true, we've solved for each cell of
the output, and can stop. It then walks down the z-axis. For each plane
encountered, any unsolved cells with which that plane interacts are adjusted,
and the solution array updated if appropriate. Note that there will always
be at least one `ncplane` interacting with each visible coordinate, due to the
default plane. The process of filling a solutions matrix is referred to as
rendering.

The next step is _rasterization_. Rather than moving down the z-axis, we now
move to the right and down on the screen, starting from the upper left corner.
At each cell, we examine the solutions matrix and the previous contents of the
cell. If they are the same, no output is emitted. If they are different, the
new glyph is written to the output, following any necessary cursor movements
and styling codes. notcurses attempts to minimize the total amount of data
written by eliding unnecessary color and style specifications, and moving the
cursor over large unchanged areas.

Using the "default color" as only one of the foreground or background requires
emitting the `op` escape followed by the appropriate escape for changing the
fore- or background (since `op` changes both at once).

## Included tools

Five binaries are built as part of notcurses:
* `notcurses-demo`: some demonstration code
* `notcurses-view`: renders visual media (images/videos)
* `notcurses-input`: decode and print keypresses
* `notcurses-planereels`: play around with ncreels
* `notcurses-tester`: unit testing

To run `notcurses-demo` from a checkout, provide the `tests/` directory via
the `-p` argument. Demos requiring data files will otherwise abort. The base
delay used in `notcurses-demo` can be changed with `-d`, accepting a
floating-point multiplier. Values less than 1 will speed up the demo, while
values greater than 1 will slow it down.

`notcurses-tester` expects `../tests/` to exist, and be populated with the
necessary data files. It can be run by itself, or via `make test`.

## Differences from NCURSES

The biggest difference, of course, is that notcurses is not an implementation
of X/Open (aka XSI) Curses, nor part of SUS4-2018.

The detailed differences between notcurses and NCURSES probably can't be fully
enumerated, and if they could, no one would want to read them. With that said,
some design decisions might surprise NCURSES programmers:

* There is no distinct `PANEL` type. The z-buffer is a fundamental property,
  and all drawable surfaces are ordered along the z axis. There is no
  equivalent to `update_panels()`.
* Scrolling is disabled by default, and cannot be globally enabled.
* The Curses `cchar_t` has a fixed-size array of `wchar_t`. The notcurses
  `cell` instead supports a UTF-8 encoded extended grapheme cluster of
  arbitrary length. The only supported charsets are `C` and `UTF-8`. notcurses
  does not generally make use of `wchar_t`.
* The hardware cursor is disabled by default, when supported (`civis` capability).
* Echoing of input is disabled by default, and `cbreak` mode is used by default.
* Colors are always specified as 24 bits in 3 components (RGB). If necessary,
  these will be quantized for the actual terminal. There are no "color pairs".
* There is no distinct "pad" concept (these are NCURSES `WINDOW`s created with
  the `newpad()` function). All drawable surfaces can exceed the display size.
* Multiple threads can freely call into notcurses, so long as they're not
  accessing the same data. In particular, it is always safe to concurrently
  mutate different `ncplane`s in different threads.
* NCURSES has thread-ignorant and thread-semi-safe versions, trace-enabled and
  traceless versions, and versions with and without support for wide characters.
  notcurses is one library: no tracing, UTF-8, thread safety.
* There is no `ESCDELAY` concept; notcurses expects that all bytes of a
  keyboard escape sequence arrive at the same time. This improves latency
  and simplifies the API.
* It is an error in NCURSES to print to the bottommost, rightmost coordinate of
  the screen when scrolling is disabled (because the cursor cannot be advanced).
  Failure to advance the cursor does not result in an error in notcurses (but
  attempting to print at the cursor when it has been advanced off the plane
  *does*).

### Features missing relative to NCURSES

This isn't "features currently missing", but rather "features I do not intend
to implement".

* There is no support for soft labels (`slk_init()`, etc.).
* There is no concept of subwindows which share memory with their parents.
* There is no tracing functionality ala `trace(3NCURSES)`. Superior external
  tracing solutions exist, such as `bpftrace`.

### Adapting NCURSES programs

Do you really want to do such a thing? NCURSES and the Curses API it implements
are far more portable and better-tested than notcurses is ever likely to be.
Will your program really benefit from notcurses's advanced features? If not,
it's probably best left as it is.

Otherwise, most NCURSES concepts have clear partners in notcurses. Any functions
making implicit use of `stdscr` ought be replaced with their explicit
equivalents. `stdscr` ought then be replaced with the result of
`notcurses_stdplane()` (the standard plane). `PANEL`s become `ncplane`s; the
Panels API is otherwise pretty close. Anything writing a bare character will
become a simple `cell`; multibyte or wide characters become complex `cell`s.
Color no longer uses "color pairs". You can easily enough hack together a
simple table mapping your colors to RGB values, and color pairs to foreground
and background indices into said table. That'll work for the duration of a
porting effort, certainly.

I have adapted two large (~5k lines of C UI code each) programs from NCURSES to
notcurses, and found it a fairly painless process. It was helpful to introduce
a shim layer, e.g. `compat_mvwprintw` for NCURSES's `mvwprintw`:

```c
static int
compat_mvwprintw(struct ncplane* nc, int y, int x, const char* fmt, ...){
  va_list va;
  va_start(va, fmt);
  if(ncplane_vprintf_yx(nc, y, x, fmt, va) < 0){
    va_end(va);
    return ERR;
  }
  va_end(va);
  return OK;
}
```

These are pretty obvious, implementation-wise.

## Environment notes

* If your terminal has an option about default interpretation of "ambiguous-width
  characters" (this is actually a technical term from Unicode), ensure it is
  set to **Wide**, not narrow. If that doesn't work, ensure it is set to
  **Narrow**, heh.

* If you can disable BiDi in your terminal, do so while running notcurses
  applications, until I have that handled better. notcurses doesn't recognize
  the BiDi state machine transitions, and thus merrily continues writing
  left-to-right. Likewise, ultra-wide glyphs will have interesting effects.
  ﷽!

* The unit tests assume dimensions of at least 80x24. They might work in a
  smaller terminal. They might not. Don't file bugs on it.

### DirectColor detection

notcurses aims to use only information found in the terminal's terminfo entry to detect capabilities, DirectColor
being one of them. Support for this is indicated by terminfo having a flag, added in NCURSES 6.1, named `RGB` set
to `true`. However, as of today there are few and far between terminfo entries which have the capability in their
database entry and so DirectColor won't be used in most cases. Terminal emulators have had for years a kludge to
work around this limitation of terminfo in the form of the `COLORTERM` environment variable which, if set to either
`truecolor` or `24bit` does the job of indicating the capability of sending the escapes 48 and 38 together with a
tripartite RGB (0 ≤ c ≤ 255 for all three components) to specify fore- and background colors.
Checking for `COLORTERM` admittedly goes against the goal stated at the top of this section but, for all practical
purposes, makes the detection work quite well **today**.

### Fonts

Fonts end up being a whole thing, little of which is pleasant. I'll write this
up someday **FIXME**.

### FAQs

* *Q:* Why didn't you just use Sixel?
* *A:* Many terminal emulators don't support Sixel. Sixel doesn't work well
       with mouse selection. With that said, I do intend to support Sixel soon,
       as a backend, when available, for certain types of drawing.

* *Q:* I'm not seeing `NCKEY_RESIZE` until I press some other key.
* *A:* You've almost certainly failed to mask `SIGWINCH` in some thread, and
       that thread is receiving the signal instead of the thread which called
       `notcurses_getc_blocking()`. As a result, the `poll()` is not
       interrupted. Call `pthread_sigmask()` before spawning any threads.

* *Q:* One of the demos claimed to spend more than 100% of its runtime rendering. Do you know how to count?
* *A:* Runtime is wall clock time. A multithreaded demo can spend more than the wall-clock time rendering if the threads contend.

* *Q:* Using the C++ wrapper, how can I ensure that the `NotCurses` destructor is run when I return from `main()`?
* *A:* As noted in the [C++ FAQ](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/dtors#artificial-block-to-control-lifetimes), wrap it in an artificial scope (this assumes your `NotCurses` is scoped to `main()`).

* *Q:* How do I hide a plane I want to make visible later?
* *A:* Either move it above and to the left of the screen (preventing resizes from making it visible), or place it underneath another (opaque) plane.

* 2019-01-04: notcurses [1.0.0 "track team, crack fiend, dying to geek"](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
    is released, six days ahead of schedule. 147 issues closed. 702 commits.
* 2019-12-18: notcurses [0.9.0 "You dig in! You dig out! You get out!"](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/releases/tag/v0.9.0),
    and also the first contributor besides myself (@grendello). Last major
    pre-GA release.
* 2019-12-05: notcurses [0.4.0 "TRAP MUSIC ALL NIGHT LONG"](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/releases/tag/v0.4.0),
    the first generally usable notcurses. I prepare a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEv2YRyiEVM),
    and release it on YouTube.
* November 2019: I begin work on [Outcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/ncreels).
    Outcurses is a collection of routines atop NCURSES, including ncreels.
    I study the history of NCURSES, primarily using Thomas E. Dickey's FAQ and
    the mailing list archives.
    * 2019-11-14: I file [Outcurses issue #56](https://github.com/dankamongmen/ncreels/issues/56)
      regarding use of DirectColor in outcurses. This is partially inspired by
      Lexi Summer Hale's essay [everything you ever wanted to know about terminals](http://xn--rpa.cc/irl/term.html).
      I get into contact with Thomas E. Dickey and confirm that what I'm hoping
      to do doesn't really fit in with the codified Curses API.
    * 2019-11-16: I make the [first commit](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/commit/635d7039d79e4f94ba645e8cb601e3a6d82a6b30)
      to notcurses.
* September 2019: I extracted fade routines from Growlight and Omphalos, and
    offered them to NCURSES as extensions. They are not accepted, which is
    understandable. I mention that I intend to extract ncreels, and offer to
    include them in the CDK (Curses Development Kit). [Growlight issue #43](https://github.com/dankamongmen/growlight/issues/43)
    is created regarding this extraction. A few minor patches go into NCURSES.
* 2011, 2013: I develop [Growlight](https://github.com/dankamongmen/growlight)
    and [Omphalos](https://github.com/dankamongmen/omphalos), complicated TUIs
    making extensive use of NCURSES.

### Thanks

* Notcurses could never be what it is without decades of tireless, likely
    thankless work by Thomas E. Dickey on NCURSES. His FAQ is a model of
    engineering history. He exemplifies documentation excellence and
    conservative, thoughtful stewardship. The free software community owes
    Mr. Dickey a great debt.
* Justine Tunney, one of my first friends at Google NYC, was always present
    with support, and pointed out the useful memstream functionality of
    POSIX, eliminating the need for me to cons up something similar.
* I one night read the entirety of Lexi Summer Hale's [essays](http://xn--rpa.cc/irl/index.html),
    and woke up intending to write notcurses.
* NES art was lifted from [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/)
    and [NES Sprite](http://nes-sprite.resampled.ru/), the kind of sites that
    make the Internet great. It probably violates any number of copyrights. C'est la vie.
* Mark Ferrari, master of the pixel, for no good reason allowed me to reproduce
    his incredible and groundbreaking color-cycling artwork. Thanks Mark!
* Finally, the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) and general
    l33t scene of the 90s and early twenty-first century endlessly inspired a
    young hax0r. There is great joy in computing; no one will drive us from
    this paradise Turing has created!

> “Our fine arts were developed, their types and uses were established, in times
very different from the present, by men whose power of action upon things was
insignificant in comparison with ours. But the amazing growth of our
techniques, the adaptability and precision they have attained, the ideas and
habits they are creating, make it a certainty that _profound changes are
impending in the ancient craft of the Beautiful_.” —Paul Valéry
