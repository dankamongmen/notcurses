# ********************************************************
# Declaration as requested by Debian FTP Masters:

# All source code originated ab initio in this project, authored by and
# copyright Nick Black, save the C++ wrappers in include/ncpp, which were
# authored by and copyright Marek Habersack and Nick Black. This includes C
# source files, C++ source files, Rust source files, Python source files, cpp
# header files, CMake files, and all other source.
#
# All Debian packaging originated ab initio in this project, save components
# generated by dh-make(1), were authored by and copyright Nick Black, with
# assistance from Robert Edmonds.
#
# Data files as packaged in the DFSG tarball's data/ were created and copyright
# Nick Black. Images were built up in the GIMP (in one case using a photograph
# taken and copyright Nick Black). Videos were created in OpenShot. The former's
# XCF and the latter's OSP sources have been included in the source package, but
# are not installed into binary packages. This allows the multimedia to be
# modified and rebuilt, but does not require this lengthy and brittle (due to
# tool version changes) step as part of the typical build nor installation.
#
# All included contents are licensed Apache-2.0.
