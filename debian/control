Package: libnotcurses1
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Recommends: ncurses-term
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Character graphics and TUI library
 notcurses facilitates the creation of modern TUI programs, making
 full use of Unicode and 24-bit direct color. Its API is similar
 to that of NCURSES, but extends that with z-buffering, rendering
 of images and video using ffmpeg, alpha blending, widgets, palette
 fades, resize awareness, and multithreading support.

Description: Character graphics and TUI library (C++ wrappers)
 notcurses facilitates the creation of modern TUI programs,
 making full use of Unicode and 24-bit direct color. It presents
 an API similar to that of Curses, and rides atop libtinfo.

Description: Character graphics and TUI library demos
 notcurses facilitates the creation of modern TUI programs,
 making full use of Unicode and 24-bit direct color. It presents
 an API similar to that of Curses, and rides atop libtinfo.
 .
 These utilities from the notcurses project include notcurses-demo
 (a demonstration of various libnotcurses capabilities) and
 notcurses-view (a character mode multimedia player), among other
 tools. Unit tests are furthermore bundled as notcurses-tester.
