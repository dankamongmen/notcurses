# DESCRIPTION

The **ncreader** widget supports free-form, multi-line input. It supports
navigation with the arrow keys and scrolling. While the visible portion of
the **ncreader** is always the same size (**physrows** by **physcols**), the
actual text backing this visible region can grow arbitrarily large.

The following option flags are supported:

* **NCREADER_OPTION_HORSCROLL**: The visual area will be backed by a plane
     that can grow arbitrarily wide.
* **NCREADER_OPTION_VERSCROLL**: The visual area will be backed by a plane
     that can grow arbitrarily high.
* **NCREADER_OPTION_NOCMDKEYS**: The typical keyboard shortcuts (see below)
     will not be honored.
* **NCREADER_OPTION_CURSOR**: The terminal's cursor will be made visible across
     the life of the **ncreader**, and its location will be managed.

The contents of the **ncreader** can be retrieved with **ncreader_contents**.

The **ncreader** consists of at least one **ncplane** (the visible editing
area). If the **ncreader** supports scrolling, it will consist of two
**ncplanes**, one of which will be kept outside the rendering area (and will
thus be invisible). **ncreader_plane** always returns the visible plane.

**ncreader_clear** drops all input from the **ncreader**, restoring it to
the same pristine condition in which it was returned by **ncreader_create**.

Unlike most widgets' input handlers, **ncreader_offer_input** will consume most
inputs. The arrow keys navigate. Backspace consumes the EGC to the left of the
cursor, if one exists. Enter moves to the first column of the next line (if
the cursor is already on the bottom line, the plane must have scrolling
enabled, or the cursor will not advance, though the Enter will still be
consumed). Otherwise, most inputs will be reproduced onto the **ncreader**
(though see NOTES below).

All the **ncreader**'s content is returned from **ncreader_contents**,
preserving whitespace.

"Emacs-style" keyboard shortcuts similar to those supported by **readline(3)**
and most shells are supported unless **NCREADER_OPTION_NOCMDKEYS** is provided
to **ncreader_create**.

# NOTES

Support for **NCREADER_OPTION_VERSCROLL** is not yet implemented.

**ncreader** does not buffer inputs in order to assemble EGCs from them. If
inputs are to be processed as EGCs (as they should), the caller would need
assemble the grapheme clusters. Of course, there is not yet any API through
which multi-codepoint EGCs could be supplied to **ncreader**.

There is not yet any support for word-wrapping. This will likely come
in the future.
