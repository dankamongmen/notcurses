**void notcurses_stats(struct notcurses* nc, ncstats* stats);**

**void notcurses_reset_stats(struct notcurses* nc, ncstats* stats);**

# DESCRIPTION

**notcurses_stats** acquires an atomic snapshot of statistics, primarily
related to notcurses_render(3). **notcurses_reset_stats** does the same, but
also resets all cumulative stats (immediate stats such as **fbbytes** are not
reset).

**renders** is the number of successful calls to **notcurses_render(3)**
or **notcurses_render_to_buffer(3)**. **failed_renders** is the number of
unsuccessful calls to these functions. **failed_renders** should be 0;
renders are not expected to fail except under exceptional circumstances.
should **notcurses_render(3)** fail while writing out a frame to the terminal,
it counts as a failed render.

**render_max_bytes** and **render_min_bytes** track the maximum and minimum
number of bytes used rasterizing a frame. A given state of Notcurses does not
correspond to a unique number of bytes; the size is also dependent on the
existing terminal state. As a first approximation, the time a terminal takes to
ingest and reflect a frame is dependent on the size of the rasterized frame.

**render_ns**, **render_max_ns**, and **render_min_ns** track the total
amount of time spent rendering and rasterizing frames in nanoseconds. Rendering
and rasterizing takes place in **notcurses_render(3)**, and is the entirety of
**notcurses_render_to_buffer(3)**. These steps are independent of the terminal.

**writeout_ns**, **writeout_max_ns**, and **writeout_min_ns** track the total
amount of time spent writing frames to the terminal. This takes place in only
**notcurses_render(3)**. If **notcurses_render_to_buffer(3)** is used, the
user is responsible for writing out the frame, and it will not be tracked by
any stat.

**cellemissions** reflects the number of EGCs written to the terminal.
**cellelisions** reflects the number of cells which were not written, due to
damage detection.

**fbbytes** is the total number of bytes devoted to framebuffers throughout
the **struct notcurses** context. **planes** is the number of planes in the
context. Neither of these stats can reach 0, due to the mandatory standard
plane.

# NOTES

Unsuccessful render operations do not contribute to the render timing stats.

# RETURN VALUES

Neither of these functions can fail. Neither returns any value.
