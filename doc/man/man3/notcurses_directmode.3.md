# DESCRIPTION

**ncdirect_init** prepares the **FILE** provided as **fp** (which must
be attached to a terminal) for colorizing and styling. On success, a pointer to
a valid **struct ncdirect** is returned. **NULL** is returned on failure.
Before the process exits, **ncdirect_stop(3)** should be called to reset the
terminal and free up resources.

An appropriate **terminfo(5)** entry must exist for the terminal. This entry is
usually selected using the value of the **TERM** environment variable (see
**getenv(3)**), but a non-**NULL** value for **termtype** will override this. An
invalid terminfo specification can lead to reduced performance, reduced
display capabilities, and/or display errors. notcurses natively targets
24bpp/8bpc RGB color, and it is thus desirable to use a terminal with the
**rgb** capability (e.g. xterm's **xterm-direct**).

**ncdirect_dim_x** returns the current number of columns, and **ncdirect_dim_y**
the current number of rows.

**ncdirect_clear** clears the screen using a control code if one exists in
terminfo. Otherwise, it prints successive newlines to scroll everything off.

**ncdirect_cursor_move_yx** moves the cursor to the specified coordinate. -1 can
be specified for either **y** or **x** to leave that axis unchanged.

**ncdirect_enable_cursor** and **ncdirect_disable_cursor** always flush the
output stream, taking effect immediately.

**ncdirect_cursor_up** and friends all move relative to the current position.
Attempting to e.g. move up while on the top row will return 0, but have no
effect.

# RETURN VALUES

**ncdirect_init** returns **NULL** on failure. Otherwise, the return value
points to a valid **struct ncdirect**, which can be used until it is provided
to **ncdirect_stop**.

All other functions return 0 on success, and non-zero on error.
