# NAME

notcurses_multiselector - high level widget for selecting from a set

# SYNOPSIS

**#include <notcurses/notcurses.h>**

```c
struct ncinput;
struct ncplane;
struct notcurses;
struct ncmultiselector;

struct ncmselector_item {
  char* option;
  char* desc;
  bool selected;
};

typedef struct ncmultiselector_options {
  char* title; // title may be NULL, inhibiting riser
  char* secondary; // secondary may be NULL
  char* footer; // footer may be NULL
  struct ncmselector_item* items; // initial items, statuses
  // default item (selected at start)
  unsigned defidx;
  // maximum number of options to display at once
  unsigned maxdisplay;
  // exhaustive styling options
  uint64_t opchannels;   // option channels
  uint64_t descchannels; // description channels
  uint64_t titlechannels;// title channels
  uint64_t footchannels; // secondary and footer channels
  uint64_t boxchannels;  // border channels
  uint64_t bgchannels;   // background channels for body
  unsigned flags;        // bitfield over NCMULTISELECTOR_OPTION_*
} ncmultiselector_options;
```

**struct ncmultiselector* ncmultiselector_create(struct ncplane* n, int y, int x, const ncmultiselector_options* opts);**

**int ncmultiselector_selected(bool* selected, unsigned n);**

**struct ncplane* ncmultiselector_plane(struct ncmultiselector* n);**

**bool ncmultiselector_offer_input(struct ncmultiselector* n, const struct ncinput* nc);**

**void ncmultiselector_destroy(struct ncmultiselector* n);**

# DESCRIPTION

# NOTES

Currently, the **ncplane** **n** provided to **ncmultiselector_create**
must not be **NULL**, though the **ncmultiselector** will always get its
own plane, and this plane will not (currently) be bound to **n**.
**ncmultiselector_selected** returns a bitmap corresponding to the
currently-selected options.

**ncmultiselector_plane** will return the **ncplane** on which the widget is
drawn.

While the **ncmultiselector** can be driven entirely by client code,
input can be run through **ncmultiselector_offer_input** to take
advantage of common controls. It will handle the up and down arrows,
along with PageUp and PageDown, and space to select/deselect options.
If the mouse is enabled, the mouse scrollwheel and mouse clicks on the scroll
arrows will be handled.
