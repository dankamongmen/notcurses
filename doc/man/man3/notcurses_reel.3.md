```c
#define NCREEL_OPTION_INFINITESCROLL 0x0001
#define NCREEL_OPTION_CIRCULAR       0x0002

struct ncreel;
struct nctablet;

typedef struct ncreel_options {
  // notcurses can draw a border around the ncreel, and also
  // around the component tablets. inhibit borders by setting all
  // valid bits in the masks. partially inhibit borders by setting
  // individual bits in the masks. the appropriate attr and pair
  // values will be used to style the borders. focused and
  // non-focused tablets can have different styles. you can instead
  // draw your own borders, or forgo borders entirely.

# DESCRIPTION

An **ncreel** is a widget for display and manipulation of hierarchal data,
intended to make effective use of the display area while supporting keyboards,
mice, and haptic interfaces. A series of **nctablet**s are ordered on a
virtual cylinder; the tablets can grow and shrink freely, while moving among
the tablets "spins" the cylinder. **ncreel**s support optional borders around
the reel and/or tablets.

**ncreel_redraw** arranges the tablets, invoking the **tabletcb** defined by
each. It will invoke the callbacks of only those tablets currently visible.
This function ought be called whenever the data within a tablet need be
refreshed. The return value of this callback is the number of lines drawn into
the **ncplane**. The tablet will be grown or shrunk as necessary to reflect
this return value.

Unless the reel is devoid of tablets, there is always a "focused" tablet (the
first tablet added to an empty reel becomes focused). The focused tablet can
change via **ncreel_next** and **ncreel_prev**. If **ncreel_del** is called on
the focused tablet, and at least one other tablet remains, some tablet receives
the focus.
