# NAME

ncls - List paths with rendering of multimedia

# SYNOPSIS

**ncls** [**-h**] [**-d**] [**-l**] [**-L**] [**-R**] [ paths ]

# DESCRIPTION

**ncls** uses a multimedia-enabled notcurses to list paths, similarly to the
**ls(1)** command, rendering images and videos to a terminal.

# OPTIONS

**-d**: list directories themselves, not their contents.

**-l**: use a long listing format.

**-L**: when showing file information for a symbolic link, show information for  the file the link references rather than for the link itself.

**-R**: list subdirectories recursively.

**-h**: Print help information, and exit with success.

paths: Run on the specified paths. If none are supplied, run on the current
directory.

# NOTES

Optimal display requires a terminal advertising the **rgb** terminfo(5)
capability, or that the environment variable **COLORTERM** is defined to
**24bit** (and that the terminal honors this variable), along with a
fixed-width font with good coverage of the Unicode Block Drawing Characters.
