//! `NcChannel*`

// - The channel components are u8 instead of u32.
//   Because of type enforcing, some runtime checks are now unnecessary.
//
// - None of the functions can't fail now. The original checks for dirty bits
//   have been substitued by mask cleaning (bitwise and)
//
// - These functions were deemed unnecessary to implement:
//   - `channel_set_rgb_clipped()`
//   - `channels_set_fg_rgb8_clipped()`
//   - `channels_set_bg_rgb8_clipped()`
