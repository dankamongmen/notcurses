/// # Description
///
/// An `NcCell` corresponds to a single character cell on some NcPlane`,
/// which can be occupied by a single [`NcEgc`] grapheme cluster (some root
/// spacing glyph, along with possible combining characters, which might span
/// multiple columns).
///
/// An NcCell is bounded to an NcPlane, but the cell doesn't store anything
/// about the plane.
///
/// At any `NcCell`, we can have a theoretically arbitrarily long UTF-8 string,
/// a foreground color, a background color, and an [`NcStyleMask`] attribute set.
///
/// Valid grapheme cluster contents include:
///
/// - A NUL terminator,
/// - A single [control character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character),
///   followed by a NUL terminator,
/// - At most one [spacing
/// character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_character#Spacing_character),
///   followed by zero or more nonspacing characters, followed by a NUL terminator.
///

/// `type in C: cell (struct)`
///
/// # More NcCell Information
///
/// ## Size
///
/// Multi-column characters can only have a single style/color throughout.
/// [`wcwidth()`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/wcwidth.3.html)
/// is not reliable. It's just quoting whether or not the [`NcEgc`]
/// contains a "Wide Asian" double-width character.
/// This is set for some things, like most emoji, and not set for
/// other things, like cuneiform.
///
/// Each cell occupies 16 static bytes (128 bits). The surface is thus ~1.6MB
/// for a (pretty large) 500x200 terminal. At 80x43, it's less than 64KB.
/// Dynamic requirements (the egcpool) can add up to 16MB to an ncplane, but
/// such large pools are unlikely in common use.
///
/// ## Alpha Compositing
///
/// We implement some small alpha compositing. Foreground and background both
/// have two bits of inverted alpha. The actual grapheme written to a cell is
/// the topmost non-zero grapheme.
///
/// - If its alpha is 00 ([`NCCELL_OPAQUE`]) its foreground color is used unchanged.
///
/// - If its alpha is 10 ([`NCCELL_TRANSPARENT`]) its foreground color is derived
///   entirely from cells underneath it.
///
/// - If its alpha is 01 ([`NCCELL_BLEND`]) the result will be a composite.
///
/// Likewise for the background. If the bottom of a coordinate's zbuffer is
/// reached with a cumulative alpha of zero, the default is used. In this way,
/// a terminal configured with transparent background can be supported through
/// multiple occluding ncplanes.
///
/// A foreground alpha of 11 ([`NCCELL_HIGHCONTRAST`]) requests high-contrast
/// text (relative to the computed background).
/// A background alpha of 11 is currently forbidden.
///
/// ## Precedence
///
/// - Default color takes precedence over palette or RGB, and cannot be used with
///   transparency.
/// - Indexed palette takes precedence over RGB. It cannot meaningfully set
///   transparency, but it can be mixed into a cascading color.
/// - RGB is used if neither default terminal colors nor palette indexing are in
///   play, and fully supports all transparency options.
///
/// ## Column width *(WIP)*
///
/// See [USAGE.md](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/blob/master/USAGE.md)
///
/// We store the column width in this field. for a multicolumn EGC of N
/// columns, there will be N nccells, and each has a width of N...for now.
/// eventually, such an EGC will set more than one subsequent cell to
/// WIDE_RIGHT, and this won't be necessary. it can then be used as a
/// bytecount. see #1203. FIXME iff width >= 2, the cell is part of a
/// multicolumn glyph. whether a cell is the left or right side of the glyph
/// can be determined by checking whether ->gcluster is zero.
