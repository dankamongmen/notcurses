A full API reference [is available](https://nick-black.com/notcurses/). Manual
pages ought have been installed along with notcurses. This document is a
secondary reference, and should not be considered authoritative. For a more
unified commentary, consider the [paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086PNVNC9)
(also available as a free PDF from https://nick-black.com).

A program wishing to use Notcurses will need to link it, ideally using the
output of `pkg-config --libs notcurses`. It is advised to compile with the
output of `pkg-config --cflags notcurses`. If using CMake, a support file is
provided, and can be accessed as `notcurses`.

Before calling into Notcurses—and usually as one of the first calls of the
program—be sure to call `setlocale(3)` with an appropriate UTF-8 locale. It is
usually appropriate to use `setlocale(LC_ALL, "")`, relying on the user to
properly set the `LANG` environment variable. Notcurses will refuse to start if
`nl_langinfo(3)` doesn't indicate `ANSI_X3.4-1968` or `UTF-8`. In addition, it
is wise to mask most signals early in the program, before any threads are
spawned (this is particularly critical for `SIGWINCH`).

Notcurses requires an available `terminfo(5)` definition appropriate for the
terminal. It is usually appropriate to pass `NULL` in the `termtype` field of a
`notcurses_options` struct, relying on the user to properly set the `TERM`
environment variable. This variable is usually set by the terminal itself. It
might be necessary to manually select a higher-quality definition for your
terminal, i.e. `xterm-direct` as opposed to `xterm` or `xterm-256color`.

Each terminal can be prepared via a call to `notcurses_init()`, which is
supplied a struct of type `notcurses_options`:

```c
// Get a human-readable string describing the running Notcurses version.
const char* notcurses_version(void);

struct cell;      // a coordinate on an ncplane: an EGC plus styling
struct ncplane;   // a drawable Notcurses surface, composed of cells
struct notcurses; // Notcurses state for a given terminal, composed of ncplanes

// These log levels consciously map cleanly to those of libav; Notcurses itself
// does not use this full granularity. The log level does not affect the opening
// and closing banners, which can be disabled via the notcurses_option struct's
// 'suppress_banner'. Note that if stderr is connected to the same terminal on
// which we're rendering, any kind of logging will disrupt the output.
typedef enum {
  NCLOGLEVEL_SILENT,  // default. print nothing once fullscreen service begins
  NCLOGLEVEL_PANIC,   // print diagnostics immediately related to crashing
  NCLOGLEVEL_FATAL,   // we're hanging around, but we've had a horrible fault
  NCLOGLEVEL_ERROR,   // we can't keep doin' this, but we can do other things
  NCLOGLEVEL_WARNING, // you probably don't want what's happening to happen
  NCLOGLEVEL_INFO,    // "standard information"
  NCLOGLEVEL_VERBOSE, // "detailed information"
  NCLOGLEVEL_DEBUG,   // this is honestly a bit much
  NCLOGLEVEL_TRACE,   // there's probably a better way to do what you want
} ncloglevel_e;

// Bits for notcurses_options->flags

// notcurses_init() will call setlocale() to inspect the current locale. If
// that locale is "C" or "POSIX", it will call setlocale(LC_ALL, "") to set
// the locale according to the LANG environment variable. Ideally, this will
// result in UTF8 being enabled, even if the client app didn't call
// setlocale() itself. Unless you're certain that you're invoking setlocale() 
// prior to notcurses_init(), you should not set this bit. Even if you are
// invoking setlocale(), this behavior shouldn't be an issue unless you're
// doing something weird (setting a locale not based on LANG).
#define NCOPTION_INHIBIT_SETLOCALE 0x0001

// Configuration for notcurses_init().
typedef struct notcurses_options {
  // The name of the terminfo database entry describing this terminal. If NULL,
  // the environment variable TERM is used. Failure to open the terminal
  // definition will result in failure to initialize notcurses.
  const char* termtype;
  // If smcup/rmcup capabilities are indicated, notcurses defaults to making
  // use of the "alternate screen". This flag inhibits use of smcup/rmcup.
  bool inhibit_alternate_screen;
  // By default, we hide the cursor if possible. This flag inhibits use of
  // the civis capability, retaining the cursor.
  bool retain_cursor;
  // We typically install a signal handler for SIGINT and SIGQUIT that restores
  // the screen, and then calls the old signal handler. Set this to inhibit
  // registration of any signal handlers.
  bool no_quit_sighandlers;
  // We typically install a signal handler for SIGWINCH that generates a resize
  // event in the notcurses_getc() queue. Set this to inhibit the handler.
  bool no_winch_sighandler;
  // Notcurses typically prints version info in notcurses_init() and
  // performance info in notcurses_stop(). This inhibits that output.
  bool suppress_banner;
  // If non-NULL, notcurses_render() will write each rendered frame to this
  // FILE* in addition to outfp. This is used primarily for debugging.
  FILE* renderfp;
  // Progressively higher log levels result in more logging to stderr. By
  // default, nothing is printed to stderr once fullscreen service begins.
  ncloglevel_e loglevel;
  // Desirable margins. If all are 0 (default), we will render to the entirety
  // of the screen. If the screen is too small, we do what we can--this is
  // strictly best-effort. Absolute coordinates are relative to the rendering
  // area ((0, 0) is always the origin of the rendering area).
  int margin_t, margin_r, margin_b, margin_l;
  // General flags; see NCOPTION_*. This is expressed as a bitfield so that
  // future options can be added without reshaping the struct. Undefined bits
  // must be set to 0.
  unsigned flags;
} notcurses_options;

// Lex a margin argument according to the standard notcurses definition. There
// can be either a single number, which will define all margins equally, or
// there can be four numbers separated by commas.
int notcurses_lex_margins(const char* op, notcurses_options* opts);

// Initialize a notcurses context on the connected terminal at 'fp'. 'fp' must
// be a tty. You'll usually want stdout. NULL can be supplied for 'fp', in
// which case /dev/tty will be opened. Returns NULL on error, including any
// failure initializing terminfo.
struct notcurses* notcurses_init(const notcurses_options* opts, FILE* fp);

// Destroy a notcurses context.
int notcurses_stop(struct notcurses* nc);
```

`notcurses_stop` should be called before exiting your program to restore the
terminal settings and free resources.

notcurses does not typically generate diagnostics (aside from the intro banner
and outro performance summary). When `stderr` is connected to the same terminal
to which graphics are being printed, printing to stderr will corrupt the output.
Setting `loglevel` to a value higher than `NCLOGLEVEL_SILENT` will cause
diagnostics to be printed to `stderr`: you could ensure `stderr` is redirected
if you make use of this functionality.

It's probably wise to export `inhibit_alternate_screen` to the user (e.g. via
command line option or environment variable). Developers and motivated users
might appreciate the ability to manipulate `loglevel` and `renderfp`. The
remaining options are typically of use only to application authors.

The notcurses API draws almost entirely into the virtual buffers of `ncplane`s.
Only upon a call to `notcurses_render` will the visible terminal display be
updated to reflect the changes:

```c
// Make the physical screen match the virtual screen. Changes made to the
// virtual screen (i.e. most other calls) will not be visible until after a
// successful call to notcurses_render().
int notcurses_render(struct notcurses* nc);

// Retrieve the contents of the specified cell as last rendered. The EGC is
// returned, or NULL on error. This EGC must be free()d by the caller. The
// attrword and channels are written to 'attrword' and 'channels', respectively.
char* notcurses_at_yx(struct notcurses* nc, int yoff, int xoff,
                      uint32_t* attrword, uint64_t* channels);
```

One `ncplane` is guaranteed to exist: the "standard plane". The user cannot
move, resize, reparent, or destroy the standard plane (it *can* be erased).
Its dimensions always match notcurses's conception of the visible terminal. A
handle on the standard plane can be acquired with two top-level functions:

```c
// Get a reference to the standard plane (one matching our current idea of the
// terminal size) for this terminal. The standard plane always exists, and its
// origin is always at the uppermost, leftmost cell of the screen.
struct ncplane* notcurses_stdplane(struct notcurses* nc);
const struct ncplane* notcurses_stdplane_const(const struct notcurses* nc);

// notcurses_stdplane(), plus free bonus dimensions written to non-NULL y/x!
static inline struct ncplane*
notcurses_stddim_yx(struct notcurses* nc, int* restrict y, int* restrict x){
  struct ncplane* s = notcurses_stdplane(nc); // can't fail
  ncplane_dim_yx(s, y, x); // accepts NULL
  return s;
}
```

A reference to the standard plane *is* persistent across a screen resize, as are
any indexes into its egcpool, but its framebuffer *is not* necessarily
persistent across a screen resize. Thankfully, you shouldn't have a reference
to its framebuffer, and thus only the change to its dimensions can really catch
you off guard.

Utility functions operating on the toplevel `notcurses` object include:

```c
// Return the topmost ncplane, of which there is always at least one.
struct ncplane* notcurses_top(struct notcurses* n);

// Return our current idea of the terminal dimensions in rows and cols.
static inline void
notcurses_term_dim_yx(const struct notcurses* n, int* restrict rows,
                      int* restrict cols){
  ncplane_dim_yx(notcurses_stdplane_const(n), rows, cols);
}

// Refresh the physical screen to match what was last rendered (i.e., without
// reflecting any changes since the last call to notcurses_render()). This is
// primarily useful if the screen is externally corrupted, or if an
// NCKEY_RESIZE event has been read and you're not ready to render.
int notcurses_refresh(struct notcurses* n, int* restrict y, int* restrict x);

// Returns a 16-bit bitmask in the LSBs of supported curses-style attributes
// (NCSTYLE_UNDERLINE, NCSTYLE_BOLD, etc.) The attribute is only
// indicated as supported if the terminal can support it together with color.
// For more information, see the "ncv" capability in terminfo(5).
unsigned notcurses_supported_styles(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Returns the number of simultaneous colors claimed to be supported, or 1 if
// there is no color support. Note that several terminal emulators advertise
// more colors than they actually support, downsampling internally.
int notcurses_palette_size(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we fade? Fading requires either the "rgb" or "ccc" terminfo capability.
bool notcurses_canfade(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we load images? This requires being built against FFmpeg/OIIO.
bool notcurses_canopen_images(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we load videos? This requires being built against FFmpeg.
bool notcurses_canopen_videos(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we change colors in the hardware palette? Requires "ccc" and "initc".
bool notcurses_canchangecolors(const struct notcurses* nc);
```

## Direct mode

"Direct mode" makes a limited subset of notcurses is available for manipulating
typical scrolling or file-backed output. These functions output directly and
immediately to the provided `FILE*`, and `notcurses_render()` is neither
supported nor necessary for such an instance. Use `ncdirect_init()` to create a
direct mode context:

```c
struct ncdirect; // minimal state for a terminal

// Initialize a direct-mode notcurses context on the connected terminal at 'fp'.
// 'fp' must be a tty. You'll usually want stdout. Direct mode supportes a
// limited subset of notcurses routines which directly affect 'fp', and neither
// supports nor requires notcurses_render(). This can be used to add color and
// styling to text in the standard output paradigm. Returns NULL on error,
// including any failure initializing terminfo.
struct ncdirect* ncdirect_init(const char* termtype, FILE* fp);

// Release 'nc' and any associated resources. 0 on success, non-0 on failure.
int ncdirect_stop(struct ncdirect* nc);
```

This context must be destroyed using `ncdirect_stop()`. The following functions
are available for direct mode:

```c
int ncdirect_fg(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned rgb);
int ncdirect_bg(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned rgb);

static inline int
ncdirect_bg_rgb8(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned r, unsigned g, unsigned b){
  if(r > 255 || g > 255 || b > 255){
    return -1;
  }
  return ncdirect_bg(nc, (r << 16u) + (g << 8u) + b);
}

static inline int
ncdirect_fg_rgb8(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned r, unsigned g, unsigned b){
  if(r > 255 || g > 255 || b > 255){
    return -1;
  }
  return ncdirect_fg(nc, (r << 16u) + (g << 8u) + b);
}

// Get the current number of columns/rows.
int ncdirect_dim_x(const struct ncdirect* nc);
int ncdirect_dim_y(const struct ncdirect* nc);

int ncdirect_fg_default(struct ncdirect* nc);
int ncdirect_bg_default(struct ncdirect* nc);
int ncdirect_styles_set(struct ncdirect* n, unsigned stylebits);
int ncdirect_styles_on(struct ncdirect* n, unsigned stylebits);
int ncdirect_styles_off(struct ncdirect* n, unsigned stylebits);
int ncdirect_clear(struct ncdirect* nc); // clear the screen

// Move the cursor in direct mode. -1 to retain current location on that axis.
int ncdirect_cursor_move_yx(struct ncdirect* n, int y, int x);
int ncdirect_cursor_enable(struct ncdirect* nc);
int ncdirect_cursor_disable(struct ncdirect* nc);

// Relative moves. num < 0 is an error.
int ncdirect_cursor_up(struct ncdirect* nc, int num);
int ncdirect_cursor_left(struct ncdirect* nc, int num);
int ncdirect_cursor_right(struct ncdirect* nc, int num);
int ncdirect_cursor_down(struct ncdirect* nc, int num);
```

## Alignment

Most functions that generate output can be aligned relative to an ncplane.
Alignment currently comes in three forms: `NCALIGN_LEFT`, `NCALIGN_CENTER`, and
`NCALIGN_RIGHT`.

```c
// Alignment within the ncplane. Left/right-justified, or centered.
typedef enum {
  NCALIGN_LEFT,
  NCALIGN_CENTER,
  NCALIGN_RIGHT,
} ncalign_e;

// Return the column at which 'c' cols ought start in order to be aligned
// according to 'align' within ncplane 'n'. Returns INT_MAX on invalid 'align'.
// Undefined behavior on negative 'c'.
static inline int
ncplane_align(const struct ncplane* n, ncalign_e align, int c){
  if(align == NCALIGN_LEFT){
    return 0;
  }
  int cols;
  ncplane_dim_yx(n, NULL, &cols);
  if(align == NCALIGN_CENTER){
    return (cols - c) / 2;
  }else if(align == NCALIGN_RIGHT){
    return cols - c;
  }
  return INT_MAX;
}
```

## Input

Input can currently be taken only from `stdin`, but on the plus side, stdin
needn't be a terminal device (unlike the ttyfp `FILE*` passed to `notcurses_init()`).
Generalized input ought happen soon. There is only one input queue per `struct
notcurses`.

Like NCURSES, notcurses will watch for escape sequences, check them against the
terminfo database, and return them as special keys (we hijack the Private Use
Area for special keys, specifically Supplementary Private Use Area B (u100000
through u10ffffd). Unlike NCURSES, the fundamental unit of input is the
UTF8-encoded Unicode codepoint. Note, however, that only one codepoint is
returned at a time (as opposed to an entire EGC).

It is generally possible for a false positive to occur, wherein keypresses
intended to be distinct are combined into an escape sequence. False negatives
where an intended escape sequence are read as an ESC key followed by distinct
keystrokes are also possible. NCURSES provides the `ESCDELAY` variable to
control timing. notcurses brooks no delay; all characters of an escape sequence
must be readable without delay for it to be interpreted as such.

```c
// All input is currently taken from stdin, though this will likely change. We
// attempt to read a single UTF8-encoded Unicode codepoint, *not* an entire
// Extended Grapheme Cluster. It is also possible that we will read a special
// keypress, i.e. anything that doesn't correspond to a Unicode codepoint (e.g.
// arrow keys, function keys, screen resize events, etc.). These are mapped
// into Unicode's Supplementary Private Use Area-B, starting at U+100000.
//
// notcurses_getc() and notcurses_getc_nblock() are both nonblocking.
// notcurses_getc_blocking() blocks until a codepoint or special key is read,
// or until interrupted by a signal.
//
// In the case of a valid read, a 32-bit Unicode codepoint is returned. 0 is
// returned to indicate that no input was available, but only by
// notcurses_getc(). Otherwise (including on EOF) (char32_t)-1 is returned.

  sigset_t sigmask;
  sigemptyset(&sigmask);

}
```

## Mice

notcurses supports mice, though only through brokers such as X or
[GPM](https://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/gpm/). It does not speak
directly to hardware. Mouse events must be explicitly enabled with a
successful call to `notcurses_mouse_enable()`, and can later be disabled.

```c
// Enable the mouse in "button-event tracking" mode with focus detection and
// UTF8-style extended coordinates. On failure, -1 is returned. On success, 0
// is returned, and mouse events will be published to notcurses_getc().
int notcurses_mouse_enable(struct notcurses* n);

// Disable mouse events. Any events in the input queue can still be delivered.
int notcurses_mouse_disable(struct notcurses* n);
```

"Button-event tracking mode" implies the ability to detect mouse button
presses, and also mouse movement while holding down a mouse button (i.e. to
effect drag-and-drop). Mouse events are returned via the `NCKEY_MOUSE*` values,
with coordinate information in the `ncinput` struct.

## Planes

Fundamental to notcurses is a z-buffer of rectilinear virtual screens, known
as `ncplane`s. An `ncplane` can be larger than the physical screen, or smaller,
or the same size; it can be entirely contained within the physical screen, or
overlap in part, or lie wholly beyond the boundaries, never to be rendered.
In addition to its framebuffer--a rectilinear matrix of cells
(see [Cells](#cells))--an `ncplane` is defined by:

* a base cell, used for any cell on the plane without a glyph,
* the egcpool backing its cells,
* a current cursor location,
* a current style, foreground channel, and background channel,
* its geometry,
* a configured user curry (a `void*`),
* its position relative to the visible plane, and
* its z-index.

If opaque, a `cell` on a higher `ncplane` completely obstructs a corresponding
`cell` from a lower `ncplane` from being seen. An `ncplane` corresponds loosely
to an [NCURSES Panel](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-intro.html#panels),
but is the primary drawing surface of notcurses—there is no object
corresponding to a bare NCURSES `WINDOW`.

In addition to `ncplane_new()`, an `ncplane` can be created aligned relative
to an existing `ncplane` (including the standard plane) using `ncplane_aligned()`.
When an `ncplane` is no longer needed, free it with `ncplane_destroy()`. To
quickly reset the `ncplane`, use `ncplane_erase()`.

```c
// Create a new ncplane at the specified offset (relative to the standard plane)
// and the specified size. The number of rows and columns must both be positive.
// This plane is initially at the top of the z-buffer, as if ncplane_move_top()
// had been called on it. The void* 'opaque' can be retrieved (and reset) later.
struct ncplane* ncplane_new(struct notcurses* nc, int rows, int cols,
                            int yoff, int xoff, void* opaque);

// Create a new ncplane aligned relative to 'n'.
struct ncplane* ncplane_aligned(struct ncplane* n, int rows, int cols,
                                int yoff, ncalign_e align, void* opaque);

// Create a plane bound to plane 'n'. Being bound to 'n' means that 'yoff' and
// 'xoff' are interpreted relative to that plane's origin, and that if that
// plane is moved later, this new plane is moved by the same amount.
struct ncplane* ncplane_bound(struct ncplane* n, int rows, int cols,
                              int yoff, int xoff, void* opaque);

// Plane 'n' will be unbound from its parent plane, if it is currently bound,
// and will be made a bound child of 'newparent', if 'newparent' is not NULL.
struct ncplane* ncplane_reparent(struct ncplane* n, struct ncplane* newparent);

// Duplicate an existing ncplane. The new plane will have the same geometry,
// will duplicate all content, and will start with the same rendering state.
// The new plane will be immediately above the old one on the z axis.
struct ncplane* ncplane_dup(struct ncplane* n, void* opaque);

// Merge the ncplane 'src' down onto the ncplane 'dst'. This is most rigorously
// defined as "write to 'dst' the frame that would be rendered were the entire
// stack made up only of 'src' and, below it, 'dst', and 'dst' was the entire
// rendering region." Merging is independent of the position of 'src' viz 'dst'
// on the z-axis. If 'src' does not intersect with 'dst', 'dst' will not be
// changed, but it is not an error. The source plane still exists following
// this operation. Do not supply the same plane for both 'src' and 'dst'.

All planes, including the standard plane, are created with scrolling disabled.
Attempting to print past the end of a line will stop at the plane boundary,
and indicate an error. On a plane 10 columns wide and two rows high, printing
"0123456789" at the origin should succeed, but printing "01234567890" will by
default fail at the eleventh character. In either case, the cursor will be left
at location 0x10; it must be moved before further printing can take place. If
scrolling is enabled, the first row will be filled with 01234546789, the second
row will have 0 written to its first column, and the cursor will end up at 1x1.
Note that it is still an error to manually attempt to move the cursor off-plane,
or to specify off-plane output. Boxes do not scroll; attempting to draw a 2x11
box on our 2x10 plane will result in an error and no output. When scrolling is
enabled, and output takes place while the cursor is past the end of the last
row, the first row is discarded, all other rows are moved up, the last row is
cleared, and output begins at the beginning of the last row. This does not take
place until output is generated (i.e. it is possible to fill a plane when
scrolling is enabled).

```c
// All planes are created with scrolling disabled. Scrolling can be dynamically
// controlled with ncplane_set_scrolling(). Returns true if scrolling was
// previously enabled, or false if it was disabled.
bool ncplane_set_scrolling(struct ncplane* n, bool scrollp);
```

Planes can be freely resized, though they must retain a positive size in
both dimensions. The powerful `ncplane_resize()` allows resizing an `ncplane`,
retaining all or a portion of the plane's existing content, and translating
the plane in one step. The helper function `ncplane_resize_simple()` allows
resizing an `ncplane` without movement, retaining all possible data. To move
the plane without resizing it or changing its content, use `ncplane_move_yx()`.
It is an error to invoke these functions on the standard plane.

```c
// Resize the specified ncplane. The four parameters 'keepy', 'keepx',
// 'keepleny', and 'keeplenx' define a subset of the ncplane to keep,
// unchanged. This may be a section of size 0, though none of these four
// parameters may be negative. 'keepx' and 'keepy' are relative to the ncplane.
// They must specify a coordinate within the ncplane's totality. 'yoff' and
// 'xoff' are relative to 'keepy' and 'keepx', and place the upper-left corner
// of the resized ncplane. Finally, 'ylen' and 'xlen' are the dimensions of the
// ncplane after resizing. 'ylen' must be greater than or equal to 'keepleny',
// and 'xlen' must be greater than or equal to 'keeplenx'. It is an error to
// attempt to resize the standard plane. If either of 'keepleny' or 'keeplenx'
// is non-zero, both must be non-zero.
//
// Essentially, the kept material does not move. It serves to anchor the
// resized plane. If there is no kept material, the plane can move freely.
int ncplane_resize(struct ncplane* n, int keepy, int keepx, int keepleny,
                       int keeplenx, int yoff, int xoff, int ylen, int xlen);

If a given cell's glyph is zero, or its foreground channel is fully transparent,
it is considered to have no foreground. A _default_ cell can be chosen for the
`ncplane`, to be consulted in this case. If the base cell's glyph is likewise
zero (or its foreground channel fully transparent), the plane's foreground is
not rendered. Note that the base cell, like every other cell, has its own
foreground and background channels.

```c
// Set the specified style bits for the ncplane 'n', whether they're actively
// supported or not.
void ncplane_styles_set(struct ncplane* n, unsigned stylebits);

// Add the specified styles to the ncplane's existing spec.

// Set the ncplane's base cell to this cell. It will be used for purposes of

                     uint32_t attrword, uint64_t channels);

// Extract the ncplane's base cell into 'c'. The reference is invalidated if
// 'ncp' is destroyed.
int ncplane_base(struct ncplane* ncp, cell* c);
```

`ncplane`s are completely ordered along an imaginary z-axis. Newly-created
`ncplane`s are on the top of the stack. They can be freely reordered.

```c
// Splice ncplane 'n' out of the z-buffer, and reinsert it at the top or bottom.
int ncplane_move_top(struct ncplane* n);
int ncplane_move_bottom(struct ncplane* n);

// Splice ncplane 'n' out of the z-buffer, and reinsert it below 'below'.
int ncplane_move_below(struct ncplane* restrict n, struct ncplane* restrict below);

// Splice ncplane 'n' out of the z-buffer, and reinsert it above 'above'.
int ncplane_move_above(struct ncplane* restrict n, struct ncplane* restrict above);

// Return the ncplane below this one, or NULL if this is at the stack's bottom.
struct ncplane* ncplane_below(struct ncplane* n);
```

Each plane holds a user pointer which can be retrieved and set (or ignored). In
addition, the plane's virtual framebuffer can be accessed (note that this does
not necessarily reflect anything on the actual screen).

```c
// Retrieve the current contents of the cell under the cursor. The EGC is
// returned, or NULL on error. This EGC must be free()d by the caller. The
// attrword and channels are written to 'attrword' and 'channels', respectively.
char* ncplane_at_cursor(struct ncplane* n, uint32_t* attrword, uint64_t* channels);

// 'lenx' can be specified as -1 to go through the boundary of the plane.
uint32_t* ncplane_rgba(const struct ncplane* nc, int begy, int begx,
                       int leny, int lenx);

// return a nul-terminated, heap copy of the current (UTF-8) contents.
API char* ncplane_contents(const struct ncplane* nc, int begy, int begx,
                           int leny, int lenx);

// Manipulate the opaque user pointer associated with this plane.
// ncplane_set_userptr() returns the previous userptr after replacing

void* ncplane_set_userptr(struct ncplane* n, void* opaque);
void* ncplane_userptr(struct ncplane* n);
```

All output is to `ncplane`s. There is no cost in moving the cursor around the
virtual framebuffer. Output that's never rendered still has some memory transfer
cost as the virtual framebuffer is prepared, but new data overwrites it in
memory.

My 14 year-old self would never forgive me if we didn't have sweet palette fades.

```c
// Called for each delta performed in a fade on ncp. If anything but 0 is returned,
// the fading operation ceases immediately, and that value is propagated out. If provided
// and not NULL, the faders will not themselves call notcurses_render().
typedef int (*fadecb)(struct notcurses* nc, struct ncplane* ncp, void* curry);

// Fade the ncplane out over the provided time, calling the specified function
// when done. Requires a terminal which supports truecolor, or at least palette
// modification (if the terminal uses a palette, our ability to fade planes is
// limited, and affected by the complexity of the rest of the screen). It is
// not safe to resize or destroy the plane during the fadeout FIXME.
int ncplane_fadeout(struct ncplane* n, const struct timespec* ts, fadecb fader, void* curry);

// Fade the ncplane in over the specified time. Load the ncplane with the
// target cells without rendering, then call this function. When it's done, the
// ncplane will have reached the target levels, starting from zeroes.
int ncplane_fadein(struct ncplane* n, const struct timespec* ts, fadecb fader, void* curry);

// Pulse the plane in and out until the callback returns non-zero, relying on
// the callback 'fader' to initiate rendering. 'ts' defines the half-period
// (i.e. the transition from black to full brightness, or back again). Proper
// use involves preparing (but not rendering) an ncplane, then calling
// ncplane_pulse(), which will fade in from black to the specified colors.
int ncplane_pulse(struct ncplane* n, const struct timespec* ts, fadecb fader, void* curry);
```

Finally, a raw stream of RGBA or BGRx data can be blitted directly to an ncplane:

```c
// Blit a flat array 'data' of BGRx 32-bit values to the ncplane 'nc', offset
// from the upper left by 'placey' and 'placex'. Each row ought occupy
// 'linesize' bytes (this might be greater than lenx * 4 due to padding). A
// subregion of the input can be specified with 'begy'x'begx' and 'leny'x'lenx'.
int ncblit_bgrx(struct ncplane* nc, int placey, int placex, int linesize,
                const unsigned char* data, int begy, int begx,
                int leny, int lenx);

// Blit a flat array 'data' of RGBA 32-bit values to the ncplane 'nc', offset
// from the upper left by 'placey' and 'placex'. Each row ought occupy

                const unsigned char* data, int begy, int begx,
                int leny, int lenx);
```

## Cells

Unlike the `notcurses` or `ncplane` objects, the definition of `cell` is
available to the user. It is somewhat ironic, then, that the user typically
needn't (and shouldn't) use `cell`s directly. Use a `cell` when the EGC being
output is used several times. In this case, time otherwise spent running
`cell_load()` (which tokenizes and verifies EGCs) can be saved. It can also be
useful to use a `cell` when the same styling is used in a discontinuous manner.

```c
// A cell corresponds to a single character cell on some plane, which can be
// occupied by a single grapheme cluster (some root spacing glyph, along with
// possible combining characters, which might span multiple columns). At any
// cell, we can have a theoretically arbitrarily long UTF-8 string, a foreground
// color, a background color, and an attribute set. Valid grapheme cluster
// contents include:
//
//  * A NUL terminator,
//  * A single control character, followed by a NUL terminator,
//  * At most one spacing character, followed by zero or more nonspacing
//    characters, followed by a NUL terminator.
//
// Multi-column characters can only have a single style/color throughout.
//
// Each cell occupies 16 static bytes (128 bits). The surface is thus ~1.6MB
// for a (pretty large) 500x200 terminal. At 80x43, it's less than 64KB.
// Dynamic requirements can add up to 16MB to an ncplane, but such large pools
// are unlikely in common use.
//
// We implement some small alpha compositing. Foreground and background both
// have two bits of inverted alpha. The actual grapheme written to a cell is
// the topmost non-zero grapheme. If its alpha is 00, its foreground color is
// used unchanged. If its alpha is 10, its foreground color is derived entirely
// from cells underneath it. Otherwise, the result will be a composite.
// Likewise for the background. If the bottom of a coordinate's zbuffer is
// reached with a cumulative alpha of zero, the default is used. In this way,
// a terminal configured with transparent background can be supported through
// multiple occluding ncplanes. A foreground alpha of 11 requests high-contrast
// text (relative to the computed background). A background alpha of 11 is
// currently forbidden.
//
// Default color takes precedence over palette or RGB, and cannot be used with
// transparency. Indexed palette takes precedence over RGB. It cannot
// meaningfully set transparency, but it can be mixed into a cascading color.
// RGB is used if neither default terminal colors nor palette indexing are in
// play, and fully supports all transparency options.
typedef struct cell {
  // These 32 bits are either a single-byte, single-character grapheme cluster
  // (values 0--0x7f), or an offset into a per-ncplane attached pool of
  // varying-length UTF-8 grapheme clusters. This pool may thus be up to 32MB.
  uint32_t gcluster;          // 4B -> 4B
  // NCSTYLE_* attributes (16 bits) + 8 foreground palette index bits + 8
  // background palette index bits. palette index bits are used only if the
  // corresponding default color bit *is not* set, and the corresponding
  // palette index bit *is* set.
  uint32_t attrword;          // + 4B -> 8B
  // (channels & 0x8000000000000000ull): left half of wide character
  // (channels & 0x4000000000000000ull): foreground is *not* "default color"
  // (channels & 0x3000000000000000ull): foreground alpha (2 bits)
  // (channels & 0x0800000000000000ull): foreground uses palette index
  // (channels & 0x0700000000000000ull): reserved, must be 0
  // (channels & 0x00ffffff00000000ull): foreground in 3x8 RGB (rrggbb)
  // (channels & 0x0000000080000000ull): right half of wide character
  // (channels & 0x0000000040000000ull): background is *not* "default color"
  // (channels & 0x0000000030000000ull): background alpha (2 bits)
  // (channels & 0x0000000008000000ull): background uses palette index
  // (channels & 0x0000000007000000ull): reserved, must be 0
  // (channels & 0x0000000000ffffffull): background in 3x8 RGB (rrggbb)
  // At render time, these 24-bit values are quantized down to terminal
  // capabilities, if necessary. There's a clear path to 10-bit support should
  // we one day need it, but keep things cagey for now. "default color" is
  // best explained by color(3NCURSES). ours is the same concept. until the
  // "not default color" bit is set, any color you load will be ignored.
  uint64_t channels;          // + 8B == 16B

```

`cell`s must be initialized with an initialization macro or `cell_init()`
before any other use. `cell_init()` and `CELL_TRIVIAL_INITIALIZER` both
simply zero out the `cell`.

```c
#define CELL_TRIVIAL_INITIALIZER { .gcluster = '\0', .attrword = 0, .channels = 0, }
#define CELL_SIMPLE_INITIALIZER(c) { .gcluster = (c), .attrword = 0, .channels = 0, }
#define CELL_INITIALIZER(c, a, chan) { .gcluster = (c), .attrword = (a), .channels = (chan), }

static inline void
cell_init(cell* c){
  memset(c, 0, sizeof(*c));
}
```

A `cell` has three fundamental elements:

* The EGC displayed at this coordinate, encoded in UTF-8. If the EGC is a
  single ASCII character (value less than 0x80), it is stored inline in
  the `cell`'s `gcluster` field. Otherwise, `gcluster`'s top 24 bits
  are a 128-biased offset into the associated `ncplane`'s egcpool. This
  implies that `cell`s are associated with `ncplane`s once prepared.
* The Curses-style attributes of the text.
* The 52 bits of foreground and background RGBA (2x8/8/8/2), plus a few flags.

The EGC should be loaded using `cell_load()`. Either a single NUL-terminated
EGC can be provided, or a string composed of multiple EGCs. In the latter case,
the first EGC from the string is loaded. Remember, backing storage for the EGC
is provided by the `ncplane` passed to `cell_load()`; if this `ncplane` is
destroyed (or even erased), the `cell` cannot safely be used. If you're done
using the `cell` before being done with the `ncplane`, call `cell_release()`
to free up the EGC resources.

```c
// Breaks the UTF-8 string in 'gcluster' down, setting up the cell 'c'. Returns
// the number of bytes copied out of 'gcluster', or -1 on failure. The styling
// of the cell is left untouched, but any resources are released.

## Reels

ncreels are a complex UI abstraction offered by notcurses, derived from my
similar work in [outcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/ncreels#ncreels).

The ncreel is a UI abstraction supported by notcurses in which
dynamically-created and -destroyed toplevel entities (referred to as tablets)
are arranged as if on a cylinder, allowing for infinite scrolling
(infinite scrolling can be disabled, resulting in a rectangle rather than a
cylinder). This works naturally with keyboard navigation, mouse scrolling wheels,
and touchpads (including the capacitive touchscreens of modern cell phones).
The term "reel" derives from slot machines. An ncreel initially has
no tablets; at any given time thereafter, it has zero or more tablets, and if
there is at least one tablet, one tablet is focused (and on-screen). If the
last tablet is removed, no tablet is focused. A tablet can support navigation
within the tablet, in which case there is an in-tablet focus for the focused
tablet, which can also move among elements within the tablet.

The ncreel object tracks the size of the screen, the size, number,
information depth, and order of tablets, and the foci. It also draws the
optional borders around tablets and the optional border of the reel itself. It
knows nothing about the actual content of a tablet, save the number of lines it
occupies at each information depth. The typical control flow is that an
application receives events (from the UI or other event sources), and calls
into notcurses saying e.g. "Tablet 2 now has 40 valid lines of information".
notcurses might then call back into the application, asking it to draw some
line(s) from some tablet(s) at some particular coordinate of that tablet's
plane. Finally, control returns to the application, and the cycle starts anew.

Each tablet might be wholly, partially, or not on-screen. notcurses always
places as much of the focused tablet as is possible on-screen (if the focused
tablet has more lines than the actual reel does, it cannot be wholly on-screen.
In this case, the focused subelements of the tablet are always on-screen). The
placement of the focused tablet depends on how it was reached (when moving to
the next tablet, offscreen tablets are brought onscreen at the bottom. When
moving to the previous tablet, offscreen tablets are brought onscreen at the
top. When moving to an arbitrary tablet which is neither the next nor previous
tablet, it will be placed in the center).

The controlling application can, at any time,

* Insert a new tablet somewhere in the reel (possibly off-screen)
* Delete a (possibly off-screen) tablet from the reel
* Change focus to the next or previous tablet, bringing it on-screen if it is off
* Change focus to some arbitrary other tablet, bringing it on-screen if it is off
* Expand or collapse the information depth of a tablet
* Change the content of a tablet, updating it if it is on-screen
  * Remove content from a tablet, possibly resizing it, and possibly changing focus within the tablet
  * Add content to the tablet, possibly resizing it, and possibly creating focus within the tablet
* Navigate within the focused tablet
* Create or destroy new planes atop the ncreel
* Indicate that the screen has been resized or needs be redrawn

A special case arises when moving among the tablets of a reel having multiple
tablets, all of which fit entirely on-screen, and infinite scrolling is in use.
Normally, upon moving to the next tablet from the bottommost tablet, the
(offscreen) next tablet is pulled up into the bottom of the reel (the reverse
is true when moving to the previous tablet from the topmost). When all tablets
are onscreen with infinite scrolling, there are two possibilities: either the
focus scrolls (moving from the bottom tablet to the top tablet, for instance),
or the reel scrolls (preserving order among the tablets, but changing their
order on-screen). In this latter case, moving to the next tablet from the
bottommost tablet results in the tablet which is gaining focus being brought to
the bottom of the screen from the top, and all other tablets moving up on the
screen. Moving to the previous tablet from the topmost tablet results in the
bottommost tablet moving to the top of the screen, and all other tablets moving
down. This behavior matches the typical behavior precisely, and avoids a rude
UI discontinuity when the tablets grow to fill the entire screen (or shrink to
not fill it). If it is not desired, however, scrolling of focus can be
configured instead.

// line-oriented, contained planes ("tablets") between which the user may
// navigate. If at least one tablet exists, there is an active tablet. As much

// left over, other tablets are included in the display. Tablets can come and go

### ncreel examples

Let's say we have a screen of 11 lines, and 3 tablets of one line each. Both
a screen border and tablet borders are in use. The tablets are A, B, and C.
No gap is in use between tablets. Xs indicate focus. If B currently has focus,
and the next tablet is selected, the result would be something like:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   A   | |                         | |   A   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "next tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |   B   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |XX C XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

If instead the previous tablet had been selected, we would of course get:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   A   | |                         | |XX A XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "prev tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |   B   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |   C   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

If A instead has the focus, choosing the "next tablet" is trivial: the tablets
do not change, and focus shifts to B. If we choose the "previous tablet", there
are three possibilities:

* Finite scrolling: No change. The tablets stay in place. A remains focused.

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |XX A XX| |                         | |XX A XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "prev tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |   B   | |     (finite scroll)     | |   B   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |   C   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

* Infinite scrolling with rotation: Focus shifts to C, which moves to the top:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |XX A XX| |                         | |XX C XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "prev tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |   B   | |  (infinite scroll with  | |   A   | |
 | --------- |        rotation)        | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |   B   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

* Infinite scrolling with focus rotation: Focus shifts to C, and moves to the bottom:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |XX A XX| |                         | |   A   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "prev tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |   B   | |  (infinite scroll with  | |   B   | |
 | --------- |     focus rotation)     | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |XX C XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

Now imagine us to have the same 3 tablets, but each is now 4 lines. It is
impossible to have two of these tablets wholly onscreen at once, let alone all
three. If we started with A focused and at the top, the result after all three
tablets have grown will be:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- | A remains at the top, and
 | |XX A XX| |                         | |XXXXXXX| | is wholly on-screen. B is
 | --------- |                         | |XX A XX| | below it, but we can show
 | --------- | ---- "grow tablet" ---> | |XXXXXXX| | only the first two lines.
 | |   B   | |       A (focused)       | |XXXXXXX| | C has been pushed
 | --------- |                         | --------- | off-screen.
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |       | |
 | --------- |                         | |   B   | |
 -------------                         -------------
```

When a tablet is enlarged, it grows towards the nearest boundary, unless that
would result in the focused tablet being moved, in which case the growing
tablet instead grows in the other direction (if the tablet is in the middle
of the screen exactly, it grows down). There is one exception to this rule: if
the tablets are not making full use of the screen, growth is always down (the
screen is always filled from the top), even if it moves the focused tablet.

A 12-line screen has three tablets: A (2 lines), B (1 line), C (1 line), filling
the screen exactly. B is focused, and grows two lines:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- | B grows down, since it is
 | |   A   | |                         | |   A   | | closer to the bottom (3
 | |       | |                         | |       | | lines) than the top (4
 | --------- | ---- "grow tablet" ---> | --------- | lines). C is pushed almost
 | --------- |       B (focused)       | --------- | entirely off-screen. A is
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |XXXXXXX| | untouched.
 | --------- |                         | |XX B XX| |
 | --------- |                         | |XXXXXXX| |
 | |   C   | |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

Starting with the same situation, A grows by 2 lines instead:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | |       | | A grows up. It would have
 | |   A   | |                         | |   A   | | grown down, but that would
 | |       | |                         | |       | | have moved B, which has
 | --------- | ---- "grow tablet" ---> | --------- | the focus. B and C remain
 | --------- |     A (not focused)     | --------- | where they are; A moves
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |XX B XX| | partially off-screen.
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |   C   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

If we started with the same situation, and B grew by 7 lines, it would first
push C entirely off-screen (B would then have four lines of text), and then
push A off-screen. B would then have eight lines of text, the maximum on a
12-line screen with both types of borders.

## Channels

A channel encodes 24 bits of RGB color, using 8 bits for each component. It
additionally provides 2 bits of alpha channel, a bit for selecting terminal
default colors, and a bit to indicate whether it describes a Wide East Asian
character. The remaining four bits are reserved. Typically two channels are
bound together in a 64-bit unsigned integer (`uint64_t`), with eight bits
currently going unused. There is such a double-channel in every `cell` and
`ncplane` object.

Usually, the higher-level `ncplane` and `cell` functionality ought be used. It
will sometimes be necessary, however, to muck with channels at their lowest
level. The channel API facilitates such muckery. All channel-related `ncplane`
and `cell` functionality is implemented in terms of this API.

## Media

When compiled against a suitable engine (FFmpeg and OpenImageIO are both
currently supported), Notcurses can populate a plane with an image or
video's character graphics equivalent. This is accomplished by decoding
and appropriately scaling an image, then emitting its pixels as Unicode
upper- and lower-half blocks (▀ and ▄, respectively). These have the
unique characteristics of completely filling their relevant areas with a
single color, and affording roughly a 1:1 aspect ratio.

```c
typedef enum {
  NCSCALE_NONE,
  NCSCALE_SCALE,
  NCSCALE_STRETCH,
} ncscale_e;

// Called for each frame rendered from 'ncv'. If anything but 0 is returned,
// the streaming operation ceases immediately, and that value is propagated out.
typedef int (*streamcb)(struct notcurses*, struct ncvisual*, void*);

// Can we load images/videos? This requires being built against FFmpeg.
bool notcurses_canopen(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Open a visual (image or video), associating it with the specified ncplane.
// Returns NULL on any error, writing the cause to 'ncerr'.
struct ncvisual* ncplane_visual_open(struct ncplane* nc, const char* file, nc_err_e* err);

// Open a visual, extract a codec and parameters, and create a new plane
// suitable for its display at 'y','x'. If there is sufficient room to display
// the visual in its native size, or if NCSCALE_NONE is passed for 'style', the
// new plane will be exactly that large. Otherwise, the plane will be as large
// as possible (given the visible screen), either maintaining aspect ratio
// (NCSCALE_SCALE) or abandoning it (NCSCALE_STRETCH).
struct ncvisual* ncvisual_from_file(struct notcurses* nc, const char* file, nc_err_e* err, int y, int x, ncscale_e style);

// Destroy an ncvisual. Rendered elements will not be disrupted, but the visual
// can be neither decoded nor rendered any further.
void ncvisual_destroy(struct ncvisual* ncv);

// extract the next frame from an ncvisual. returns NCERR_EOF on end of file,
// and NCERR_SUCCESS on success, otherwise some other NCERR.
nc_err_e ncvisual_decode(struct ncvisual* nc);

// Render the decoded frame to the associated ncplane. The frame will be scaled
// to the size of the ncplane per the ncscale_e style. A subregion of the
// frame can be specified using 'begx', 'begy', 'lenx', and 'leny'. To render
// the rectangle formed by begy x begx and the lower-right corner, -1 can be
// supplied to 'leny' and 'lenx'. {0, 0, -1, -1} will thus render the entire
// visual. Negative values for 'begy' or 'begx' are an error. It is an error to
// specify any region beyond the boundaries of the frame. Returns the number of
// cells written, or -1 on failure.
int ncvisual_render(const struct ncvisual* ncv, int begy, int begx, int leny, int lenx);

// Shut up and display my frames! Provide as an argument to ncvisual_stream().
// If you'd like subtitles to be decoded, provide an ncplane as the curry. If the
// curry is NULL, subtitles will not be displayed.
static inline int
ncvisual_simple_streamer(struct notcurses* nc, struct ncvisual* ncv, void* curry){
  if(notcurses_render(nc)){
    return -1;
  }
  int ret = 0;
  if(curry){
    // need a cast for C++ callers
    struct ncplane* subncp = (struct ncplane*)curry;
    char* subtitle = ncvisual_subtitle(ncv);
    if(subtitle){
      if(ncplane_putstr_yx(subncp, 0, 0, subtitle) < 0){
        ret = -1;
      }
      free(subtitle);
    }
  }
  return ret;
}

// Stream the entirety of the media, according to its own timing. Blocking,
// obviously. streamer may be NULL; it is otherwise called for each frame, and
// its return value handled as outlined for stream cb. If streamer() returns
// non-zero, the stream is aborted, and that value is returned. By convention,
// return a positive number to indicate intentional abort from within
// streamer(). 'timescale' allows the frame duration time to be scaled. For a
// visual naturally running at 30FPS, a 'timescale' of 0.1 will result in
// 300FPS, and a 'timescale' of 10 will result in 3FPS. It is an error to
// supply 'timescale' less than or equal to 0.
int ncvisual_stream(struct notcurses* nc, struct ncvisual* ncv, nc_err_e* err, float timescale, streamcb streamer, void* curry);

// Return the plane to which this ncvisual is bound.
struct ncplane* ncvisual_plane(struct ncvisual* ncv);

// If a subtitle ought be displayed at this time, return a heap-allocated copy
// of the UTF8 text.
char* ncvisual_subtitle(const struct ncvisual* ncv);

// Rotate the visual 'rads' radians. If we own the bound plane, it is resized
// to fit the rotated visual, if necessary. Only M_PI/2 and -M_PI/2 are
// supported at the moment, but this will change FIXME.
int ncvisual_rotate(struct ncvisual* n, double rads);
```

It is also possible to seed an `ncvisual` directly from memory, without involving
a file. Both RGBA and BGRA 8bpc arrangements can be used.

```c
// Prepare an ncvisual, and its underlying plane, based off RGBA content in
// memory at 'rgba'. 'rgba' must be a flat array of 32-bit 8bpc RGBA pixels.
// These must be arranged in 'rowstride' lines, where the first 'cols' * 4b
// are actual data. There must be 'rows' lines. The total size of 'rgba'
// must thus be at least (rows * rowstride) bytes, of which (rows * cols * 4)
// bytes are actual data. The resulting plane will be ceil('rows'/2)x'cols'.
struct ncvisual* ncvisual_from_rgba(struct notcurses* nc, const void* rgba,
                                    int rows, int rowstride, int cols);

// ncvisual_from_rgba(), but for BGRA.
struct ncvisual* ncvisual_from_bgra(struct notcurses* nc, const void* bgra,
                                    int rows, int rowstride, int cols);
```

Finally, an `ncvisual` can be "promoted" from the contents of a plane.

```c
// Promote an ncplane 'n' to an ncvisual. The plane should not be associated
// with an existing ncvisual, and may contain only spaces, half blocks, and
// full blocks. The latter will be checked, and any other glyph will result
// in a NULL being returned. This function exists so that planes can be
// subjected to ncvisual transformations. If possible, it's usually better
// to create the ncvisual from memory using ncvisual_from_rgba().
struct ncvisual* ncvisual_from_plane(struct ncplane* n);
```
