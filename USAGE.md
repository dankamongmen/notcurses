A full API reference [is available](https://nick-black.com/notcurses/). Manual
pages ought have been installed along with Notcurses. This document is a
secondary reference, and should not be considered authoritative. For a more
unified commentary, consider the [paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086PNVNC9)
(also available as a free PDF from https://nick-black.com).

A program wishing to use Notcurses will need to link it, ideally using the
output of `pkg-config --libs notcurses`. It is advised to compile with the
output of `pkg-config --cflags notcurses`. If using CMake, a support file is
provided, and can be accessed as `Notcurses`.

Before calling into Notcurses—and usually as one of the first calls of the
program—be sure to call `setlocale(3)` with an appropriate UTF-8 locale. It is
usually appropriate to use `setlocale(LC_ALL, "")`, relying on the user to
properly set the `LANG` environment variable. Notcurses will refuse to start if
`nl_langinfo(3)` doesn't indicate `ANSI_X3.4-1968` or `UTF-8`. In addition, it
is wise to mask most signals early in the program, before any threads are
spawned (this is particularly critical for `SIGWINCH`).

Notcurses requires an available `terminfo(5)` definition appropriate for the
terminal. It is usually appropriate to pass `NULL` in the `termtype` field of a
`notcurses_options` struct, relying on the user to properly set the `TERM`
environment variable. This variable is usually set by the terminal itself. It
might be necessary to manually select a higher-quality definition for your
terminal, i.e. `xterm-direct` as opposed to `xterm` or `xterm-256color`.

Each terminal can be prepared via a call to `notcurses_init()`, which is
supplied a struct of type `notcurses_options`:

```c
// Get a human-readable string describing the running Notcurses version.
const char* notcurses_version(void);

// Cannot be inline, as we want to get the versions of the actual Notcurses
// library we loaded, not what we compile against.
void notcurses_version_components(int* major, int* minor, int* patch, int* tweak);

struct cell;      // a coordinate on an ncplane: an EGC plus styling
struct ncplane;   // a drawable Notcurses surface, composed of cells
struct notcurses; // Notcurses state for a given terminal, composed of ncplanes

// These log levels consciously map cleanly to those of libav; Notcurses itself
// does not use this full granularity. The log level does not affect the opening
// and closing banners, which can be disabled via the Notcurses_option struct's
// 'suppress_banner'. Note that if stderr is connected to the same terminal on
// which we're rendering, any kind of logging will disrupt the output.
typedef enum {
  NCLOGLEVEL_SILENT,  // default. print nothing once fullscreen service begins
  NCLOGLEVEL_PANIC,   // print diagnostics immediately related to crashing
  NCLOGLEVEL_FATAL,   // we're hanging around, but we've had a horrible fault
  NCLOGLEVEL_ERROR,   // we can't keep doin' this, but we can do other things
  NCLOGLEVEL_WARNING, // you probably don't want what's happening to happen
  NCLOGLEVEL_INFO,    // "standard information"
  NCLOGLEVEL_VERBOSE, // "detailed information"
  NCLOGLEVEL_DEBUG,   // this is honestly a bit much
  NCLOGLEVEL_TRACE,   // there's probably a better way to do what you want
} ncloglevel_e;

// Bits for notcurses_options->flags

// notcurses_init() will call setlocale() to inspect the current locale. If
// that locale is "C" or "POSIX", it will call setlocale(LC_ALL, "") to set
// the locale according to the LANG environment variable. Ideally, this will
// result in UTF8 being enabled, even if the client app didn't call
// setlocale() itself. Unless you're certain that you're invoking setlocale() 
// prior to notcurses_init(), you should not set this bit. Even if you are
// invoking setlocale(), this behavior shouldn't be an issue unless you're
// doing something weird (setting a locale not based on LANG).

  // of the screen. If the screen is too small, we do what we can--this is

  int margin_t, margin_r, margin_b, margin_l;
  // General flags; see NCOPTION_*. This is expressed as a bitfield so that
  // future options can be added without reshaping the struct. Undefined bits
  // must be set to 0.
  uint64_t flags;
} notcurses_options;

// Lex a margin argument according to the standard Notcurses definition. There
// can be either a single number, which will define all margins equally, or
// there can be four numbers separated by commas.
int notcurses_lex_margins(const char* op, notcurses_options* opts);

// Initialize a Notcurses context on the connected terminal at 'fp'. 'fp' must
// be a tty. You'll usually want stdout. NULL can be supplied for 'fp', in
// which case /dev/tty will be opened. Returns NULL on error, including any
// failure initializing terminfo.
struct notcurses* notcurses_init(const notcurses_options* opts, FILE* fp);

// Destroy a Notcurses context.
int notcurses_stop(struct notcurses* nc);
```

`notcurses_stop` should be called before exiting your program to restore the
terminal settings and free resources.

notcurses does not typically generate diagnostics (aside from the intro banner
and outro performance summary). When `stderr` is connected to the same terminal
to which graphics are being printed, printing to stderr will corrupt the output.
Setting `loglevel` to a value higher than `NCLOGLEVEL_SILENT` will cause
diagnostics to be printed to `stderr`: you could ensure `stderr` is redirected
if you make use of this functionality.

It's probably wise to export `NCOPTION_NO_ALTERNATE_SCREEN` to the user (e.g. via
command line option or environment variable). Developers and motivated users
might appreciate the ability to manipulate `loglevel` and `renderfp`. The
remaining options are typically of use only to application authors.

The Notcurses API draws almost entirely into the virtual buffers of `ncplane`s.
Only upon a call to `notcurses_render` will the visible terminal display be
updated to reflect the changes:

```c
// Make the physical screen match the virtual screen. Changes made to the
// virtual screen (i.e. most other calls) will not be visible until after a
// successful call to notcurses_render().
int notcurses_render(struct notcurses* nc);

// Perform the rendering and rasterization portion of notcurses_render(), but
// do not write the resulting buffer out to the terminal. Using this function,
// the user can control the writeout process, and render a second frame while
// writing another. The returned buffer must be freed by the caller.
int notcurses_render_to_buffer(struct notcurses* nc, char** buf, size_t* buflen);

// Write the last rendered frame, in its entirety, to 'fp'. If
// notcurses_render() has not yet been called, nothing will be written.
int notcurses_render_to_file(struct notcurses* nc, FILE* fp);

// Retrieve the contents of the specified cell as last rendered. The EGC is
// returned, or NULL on error. This EGC must be free()d by the caller. The
// styles and channels are written to 'attrword' and 'channels', respectively.
char* notcurses_at_yx(struct notcurses* nc, int yoff, int xoff,
                      uint16_t* styles, uint64_t* channels);
```

One `ncplane` is guaranteed to exist: the "standard plane". The user cannot
move, resize, reparent, or destroy the standard plane (it *can* be erased).
Its dimensions always match notcurses's conception of the visible terminal. A
handle on the standard plane can be acquired with two top-level functions:

```c
// Get a reference to the standard plane (one matching our current idea of the
// terminal size) for this terminal. The standard plane always exists, and its
// origin is always at the uppermost, leftmost cell of the screen.
struct ncplane* notcurses_stdplane(struct notcurses* nc);
const struct ncplane* notcurses_stdplane_const(const struct notcurses* nc);

// notcurses_stdplane(), plus free bonus dimensions written to non-NULL y/x!
static inline struct ncplane*
notcurses_stddim_yx(struct notcurses* nc, int* restrict y, int* restrict x){
  struct ncplane* s = notcurses_stdplane(nc); // can't fail
  ncplane_dim_yx(s, y, x); // accepts NULL
  return s;
}

static inline const struct ncplane*
notcurses_stddim_yx_const(const struct notcurses* nc, int* restrict y, int* restrict x){
  const struct ncplane* s = notcurses_stdplane_const(nc); // can't fail
  ncplane_dim_yx(s, y, x); // accepts NULL
  return s;
}

```

A reference to the standard plane *is* persistent across a screen resize, as are
any indexes into its egcpool, but its framebuffer *is not* necessarily
persistent across a screen resize. Thankfully, you shouldn't have a reference
to its framebuffer, and thus only the change to its dimensions can really catch
you off guard.

Utility functions operating on the toplevel `notcurses` object include:

```c
// Return the topmost ncplane, of which there is always at least one.
struct ncplane* notcurses_top(struct notcurses* n);

// Return the bottommost ncplane, of which there is always at least one.
struct ncplane* notcurses_bottom(struct notcurses* n);

// Return our current idea of the terminal dimensions in rows and cols.
static inline void
notcurses_term_dim_yx(const struct notcurses* n, int* restrict rows,
                      int* restrict cols){
  ncplane_dim_yx(notcurses_stdplane_const(n), rows, cols);
}

// Refresh the physical screen to match what was last rendered (i.e., without
// reflecting any changes since the last call to notcurses_render()). This is
// primarily useful if the screen is externally corrupted, or if an
// NCKEY_RESIZE event has been read and you're not ready to render.
int notcurses_refresh(struct notcurses* n, int* restrict y, int* restrict x);

// Enable or disable the terminal's cursor, if supported. Immediate effect.
// It is an error to supply coordinates outside of the standard plane.
void notcurses_cursor_enable(struct notcurses* nc, int y, int x);
void notcurses_cursor_disable(struct notcurses* nc);

// Returns a 16-bit bitmask in the LSBs of supported curses-style attributes
// (NCSTYLE_UNDERLINE, NCSTYLE_BOLD, etc.) The attribute is only
// indicated as supported if the terminal can support it together with color.
// For more information, see the "ncv" capability in terminfo(5).
unsigned notcurses_supported_styles(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Returns the number of simultaneous colors claimed to be supported, or 1 if
// there is no color support. Note that several terminal emulators advertise
// more colors than they actually support, downsampling internally.
unsigned notcurses_palette_size(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we fade? Fading requires either the "rgb" or "ccc" terminfo capability.
bool notcurses_canfade(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we directly specify RGB values per cell, or only use palettes?
bool notcurses_can_truecolor(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we load images? This requires being built against FFmpeg/OIIO.
bool notcurses_canopen_images(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we load videos? This requires being built against FFmpeg.
bool notcurses_canopen_videos(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we change colors in the hardware palette? Requires "ccc" and "initc".
bool notcurses_canchangecolor(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Is our encoding UTF-8? Requires LANG being set to a UTF-8 locale.
bool notcurses_canutf8(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Can we blit to Sixel? This requires being built against libsixel.
bool notcurses_cansixel(const struct notcurses* nc);
```

## Direct mode

"Direct mode" makes a limited subset of Notcurses is available for manipulating
typical scrolling or file-backed output. Its functions are exported via
`<notcurses/direct.h>`, and output directly and immediately to the provided
`FILE*`. `notcurses_render()` is neither supported nor necessary for such an
instance. Use `ncdirect_init()` to create a direct mode context:

```c
struct ncdirect; // minimal state for a terminal

// Initialize a direct-mode Notcurses context on the connected terminal at 'fp'.
// 'fp' must be a tty. You'll usually want stdout. Direct mode supports a
// limited subset of Notcurses routines which directly affect 'fp', and neither
// supports nor requires notcurses_render(). This can be used to add color and
// styling to text in the standard output paradigm. 'flags' is a bitmask over
// NCDIRECT_OPTION_*.
// Returns NULL on error, including any failure initializing terminfo.
struct ncdirect* ncdirect_init(const char* termtype, FILE* fp, uint64_t flags);

// ncdirect_init() will call setlocale() to inspect the current locale. If
// that locale is "C" or "POSIX", it will call setlocale(LC_ALL, "") to set
// the locale according to the LANG environment variable. Ideally, this will
// result in UTF8 being enabled, even if the client app didn't call
// setlocale() itself. Unless you're certain that you're invoking setlocale()
// prior to notcurses_init(), you should not set this bit. Even if you are
// invoking setlocale(), this behavior shouldn't be an issue unless you're
// doing something weird (setting a locale not based on LANG).
#define NCDIRECT_OPTION_INHIBIT_SETLOCALE 0x0001ull

// *Don't* place the terminal into cbreak mode (see tcgetattr(3)). By default,
// echo and line buffering are turned off.
#define NCDIRECT_OPTION_INHIBIT_CBREAK    0x0002ull

// Release 'nc' and any associated resources. 0 on success, non-0 on failure.
int ncdirect_stop(struct ncdirect* nc);
```

This context must be destroyed using `ncdirect_stop()`. The following functions
are available for direct mode:

```c
int ncdirect_fg_rgb(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned rgb);
int ncdirect_bg_rgb(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned rgb);

static inline int
ncdirect_bg_rgb8(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned r, unsigned g, unsigned b){
  if(r > 255 || g > 255 || b > 255){
    return -1;
  }
  return ncdirect_bg_rgb(nc, (r << 16u) + (g << 8u) + b);
}

static inline int
ncdirect_fg_rgb8(struct ncdirect* nc, unsigned r, unsigned g, unsigned b){
  if(r > 255 || g > 255 || b > 255){
    return -1;
  }
  return ncdirect_fg_rgb(nc, (r << 16u) + (g << 8u) + b);
}

// Get the current number of columns/rows.
int ncdirect_dim_x(const struct ncdirect* nc);
int ncdirect_dim_y(const struct ncdirect* nc);

int ncdirect_fg_default(struct ncdirect* nc);
int ncdirect_bg_default(struct ncdirect* nc);
int ncdirect_styles_set(struct ncdirect* n, unsigned stylebits);
int ncdirect_styles_on(struct ncdirect* n, unsigned stylebits);
int ncdirect_styles_off(struct ncdirect* n, unsigned stylebits);
int ncdirect_clear(struct ncdirect* nc); // clear the screen

// Move the cursor in direct mode. -1 to retain current location on that axis.
int ncdirect_cursor_move_yx(struct ncdirect* n, int y, int x);
int ncdirect_cursor_enable(struct ncdirect* nc);
int ncdirect_cursor_disable(struct ncdirect* nc);

// Relative moves. num < 0 is an error.
int ncdirect_cursor_up(struct ncdirect* nc, int num);
int ncdirect_cursor_left(struct ncdirect* nc, int num);
int ncdirect_cursor_right(struct ncdirect* nc, int num);
int ncdirect_cursor_down(struct ncdirect* nc, int num);

// Get the cursor position, when supported. This requires writing to the
// terminal, and then reading from it. If the terminal doesn't reply, or
// doesn't reply in a way we understand, the results might be deleterious.
int ncdirect_cursor_yx(struct ncdirect* n, int* y, int* x);

// Push or pop the cursor location to the terminal's stack. The depth of this
// stack, and indeed its existence, is terminal-dependent.
int ncdirect_cursor_push(struct ncdirect* n);
int ncdirect_cursor_pop(struct ncdirect* n);

// Formatted printing (plus alignment relative to the terminal).
int ncdirect_printf_aligned(struct ncdirect* n, int y, ncalign_e align,
                            const char* fmt, ...)
  __attribute__ ((format (printf, 4, 5)));

// Draw horizontal/vertical lines using the specified channels, interpolating
// between them as we go. The EGC may not use more than one column. For a
// horizontal line, |len| cannot exceed the screen width minus the cursor's
// offset. For a vertical line, it may be as long as you'd like; the screen
// will scroll as necessary. All lines start at the current cursor position.
int ncdirect_hline_interp(struct ncdirect* n, const char* egc, int len,
                          uint64_t h1, uint64_t h2);
int ncdirect_vline_interp(struct ncdirect* n, const char* egc, int len,
                          uint64_t h1, uint64_t h2);

// Draw a box with its upper-left corner at the current cursor position, having
// dimensions |ylen|x|xlen|. See ncplane_box() for more information. The
// minimum box size is 2x2, and it cannot be drawn off-screen. |wchars| is an
// array of 6 wide characters: UL, UR, LL, LR, HL, VL.
int ncdirect_box(struct ncdirect* n, uint64_t ul, uint64_t ur,
                 uint64_t ll, uint64_t lr, const wchar_t* wchars,
                 int ylen, int xlen, unsigned ctlword);

// ncdirect_box() with the rounded box-drawing characters
int ncdirect_rounded_box(struct ncdirect* n, uint64_t ul, uint64_t ur,
                         uint64_t ll, uint64_t lr,
                         int ylen, int xlen, unsigned ctlword);

// ncdirect_box() with the double box-drawing characters
int ncdirect_double_box(struct ncdirect* n, uint64_t ul, uint64_t ur,
                        uint64_t ll, uint64_t lr,
                        int ylen, int xlen, unsigned ctlword);

// Display an image using the specified blitter and scaling. The image may
// be arbitrarily many rows -- the output will scroll -- but will only occupy
// the column of the cursor, and those to the right.
int ncdirect_render_image(struct ncdirect* nc, const char* filename,
                          ncblitter_e blitter, ncscale_e scale);
```

Several of the Notcurses capability predicates have `ncdirect` analogues:

```c
bool ncdirect_canopen_images(const struct ncdirect* n);
bool ncdirect_canutf8(const struct ncdirect* n);
```

## Alignment

Most functions that generate output can be aligned relative to an ncplane.
Alignment currently comes in three forms: `NCALIGN_LEFT`, `NCALIGN_CENTER`, and
`NCALIGN_RIGHT`.

```c
// Alignment within the ncplane. Left/right-justified, or centered.
typedef enum {
  NCALIGN_LEFT,
  NCALIGN_CENTER,
  NCALIGN_RIGHT,
} ncalign_e;

// Return the column at which 'c' cols ought start in order to be aligned
// according to 'align' within ncplane 'n'. Returns INT_MAX on invalid 'align'.
// Undefined behavior on negative 'c'.
static inline int
ncplane_align(const struct ncplane* n, ncalign_e align, int c){
  if(align == NCALIGN_LEFT){
    return 0;
  }
  int cols;
  ncplane_dim_yx(n, NULL, &cols);
  if(align == NCALIGN_CENTER){
    return (cols - c) / 2;
  }else if(align == NCALIGN_RIGHT){
    return cols - c;
  }
  return INT_MAX;
}
```

## Input

Input can currently be taken only from `stdin`, but on the plus side, stdin
needn't be a terminal device (unlike the ttyfp `FILE*` passed to `notcurses_init()`).
Generalized input ought happen soon. There is only one input queue per `struct
notcurses`.

Like NCURSES, Notcurses will watch for escape sequences, check them against the
terminfo database, and return them as special keys (we hijack the Private Use
Area for special keys, specifically Supplementary Private Use Area B (u100000
through u10ffffd). Unlike NCURSES, the fundamental unit of input is the
UTF8-encoded Unicode codepoint. Note, however, that only one codepoint is
returned at a time (as opposed to an entire EGC).

It is generally possible for a false positive to occur, wherein keypresses
intended to be distinct are combined into an escape sequence. False negatives
where an intended escape sequence are read as an ESC key followed by distinct
keystrokes are also possible. NCURSES provides the `ESCDELAY` variable to
control timing. Notcurses brooks no delay; all characters of an escape sequence
must be readable without delay for it to be interpreted as such.

```c
// All input is currently taken from stdin, though this will likely change. We
// attempt to read a single UTF8-encoded Unicode codepoint, *not* an entire
// Extended Grapheme Cluster. It is also possible that we will read a special
// keypress, i.e. anything that doesn't correspond to a Unicode codepoint (e.g.
// arrow keys, function keys, screen resize events, etc.). These are mapped
// into Unicode's Supplementary Private Use Area-B, starting at U+100000.
//
// notcurses_getc() and notcurses_getc_nblock() are both nonblocking.
// notcurses_getc_blocking() blocks until a codepoint or special key is read,
// or until interrupted by a signal.
//
// In the case of a valid read, a 32-bit Unicode codepoint is returned. 0 is
// returned to indicate that no input was available, but only by
// notcurses_getc(). Otherwise (including on EOF) (char32_t)-1 is returned.

## Mice

notcurses supports mice, though only through brokers such as X or
[GPM](https://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/gpm/). It does not speak
directly to hardware. Mouse events must be explicitly enabled with a
successful call to `notcurses_mouse_enable()`, and can later be disabled.

```c
// Enable the mouse in "button-event tracking" mode with focus detection and
// UTF8-style extended coordinates. On failure, -1 is returned. On success, 0
// is returned, and mouse events will be published to notcurses_getc().
int notcurses_mouse_enable(struct notcurses* n);

// Disable mouse events. Any events in the input queue can still be delivered.
int notcurses_mouse_disable(struct notcurses* n);
```

"Button-event tracking mode" implies the ability to detect mouse button
presses, and also mouse movement while holding down a mouse button (i.e. to
effect drag-and-drop). Mouse events are returned via the `NCKEY_MOUSE*` values,
with coordinate information in the `ncinput` struct.

## Planes

Fundamental to Notcurses is a z-buffer of rectilinear virtual screens, known
as `ncplane`s. An `ncplane` can be larger than the physical screen, or smaller,
or the same size; it can be entirely contained within the physical screen, or
overlap in part, or lie wholly beyond the boundaries, never to be rendered.
In addition to its framebuffer--a rectilinear matrix of cells
(see [Cells](#cells))--an `ncplane` is defined by:

* a base cell, used for any cell on the plane without a glyph,
* the egcpool backing its cells,
* a current cursor location,
* a current style, foreground channel, and background channel,
* its geometry,
* a configured user curry (a `void*`),
* its position relative to the visible plane,
* its z-index, and
* a name (used only for debugging).

If opaque, a `cell` on a higher `ncplane` completely obstructs a corresponding
`cell` from a lower `ncplane` from being seen. An `ncplane` corresponds loosely
to an [NCURSES Panel](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-intro.html#panels),
but is the primary drawing surface of notcurses—there is no object
corresponding to a bare NCURSES `WINDOW`.

An `ncplane` can be created aligned relative to an existing `ncplane`
(including the standard plane) using `NCPLANE_OPTION_HORALIGNED`.

When an `ncplane` is no longer needed, free it with
`ncplane_destroy()`. To quickly reset the `ncplane`, use `ncplane_erase()`.

```c
#define NCPLANE_OPTION_HORALIGNED 0x0001ull
#define NCPLANE_OPTION_NEWPILE    0x0002ull

typedef struct ncplane_options {
  int y;            // vertical placement relative to parent plane
  int x;            // horizontal placement relative to parent plane
  int rows;         // number of rows, must be positive
  int cols;         // number of columns, must be positive
  void* userptr;    // user curry, may be NULL
  const char* name; // name (used only for debugging), may be NULL
  int (*resizecb)(struct ncplane*); // callback when parent is resized
  uint64_t flags;   // closure over NCPLANE_OPTION_*
} ncplane_options;

// Create a new ncplane bound to plane 'n', at the offset 'y'x'x' (relative to
// the origin of 'n') and the specified size. The number of 'rows' and 'cols'
// must both be positive. This plane is initially at the top of the z-buffer,
// as if ncplane_move_top() had been called on it. The void* 'userptr' can be
// retrieved (and reset) later. A 'name' can be set, used in debugging.
struct ncplane* ncplane_create(struct ncplane* n, const ncplane_options* nopts);

// Plane 'n' will be unbound from its parent plane, and will be made a bound
// child of 'newparent'. It is an error if 'n' or 'newparent' are NULL. If
// 'newparent' is equal to 'n', 'n' becomes the root of a new pile, unless 'n'
// is already the root of a pile, in which case this is a no-op. Returns 'n'.
// The standard plane cannot be reparented. Any planes bound to 'n' are
// reparented to the previous parent of 'n'.
struct ncplane* ncplane_reparent(struct ncplane* n, struct ncplane* newparent);

// The same as ncplane_reparent(), except any planes bound to 'n' come along
// with it to its new destination. Their z-order is maintained.
struct ncplane* ncplane_reparent_family(struct ncplane* n, struct ncplane* newparent);

// Replace the ncplane's existing resizecb with 'resizecb' (which may be NULL).
void ncplane_set_resizecb(struct ncplane* n, int(*resizecb)(struct ncplane*));

// Returns the ncplane's current resize callback.
int (*ncplane_resizecb(const struct ncplane* n))(struct ncplane*);

// Suitable for use as a 'resizecb'. This will realign the plane 'n' against its
// parent, using the alignment specified at ncplane_create()-time.
int ncplane_resize_realign(struct ncplane* n);

// Get the plane to which the plane 'n' is bound, if any.
struct ncplane* ncplane_parent(struct ncplane* n);
const struct ncplane* ncplane_parent_const(const struct ncplane* n);

// Duplicate an existing ncplane. The new plane will have the same geometry,
// will duplicate all content, and will start with the same rendering state.
struct ncplane* ncplane_dup(struct ncplane* n, void* opaque);

// Merge the ncplane 'src' down onto the ncplane 'dst'. This is most rigorously
// defined as "write to 'dst' the frame that would be rendered were the entire
// stack made up only of 'src' and, below it, 'dst', and 'dst' was the entire
// rendering region." Merging is independent of the position of 'src' viz 'dst'
// on the z-axis. If 'src' does not intersect with 'dst', 'dst' will not be
// changed, but it is not an error. The source plane still exists following
// this operation. Do not supply the same plane for both 'src' and 'dst'.
int ncplane_mergedown(struct ncplane* restrict src, struct ncplane* restrict dst);

// Erase every cell in the ncplane, resetting all attributes to normal, all
// colors to the default color, and all cells to undrawn. All cells associated
// with this ncplane are invalidated, and must not be used after the call,
// excluding the base cell. The cursor is homed.
void ncplane_erase(struct ncplane* n);
```

All planes, including the standard plane, are created with scrolling disabled.
Attempting to print past the end of a line will stop at the plane boundary,
and indicate an error. On a plane 10 columns wide and two rows high, printing
"0123456789" at the origin should succeed, but printing "01234567890" will by
default fail at the eleventh character. In either case, the cursor will be left
at location 0x10; it must be moved before further printing can take place. If
scrolling is enabled, the first row will be filled with 01234546789, the second
row will have 0 written to its first column, and the cursor will end up at 1x1.
Note that it is still an error to manually attempt to move the cursor off-plane,
or to specify off-plane output. Boxes do not scroll; attempting to draw a 2x11
box on our 2x10 plane will result in an error and no output. When scrolling is
enabled, and output takes place while the cursor is past the end of the last
row, the first row is discarded, all other rows are moved up, the last row is
cleared, and output begins at the beginning of the last row. This does not take
place until output is generated (i.e. it is possible to fill a plane when
scrolling is enabled).

```c
// All planes are created with scrolling disabled. Scrolling can be dynamically
// controlled with ncplane_set_scrolling(). Returns true if scrolling was
// previously enabled, or false if it was disabled.
bool ncplane_set_scrolling(struct ncplane* n, bool scrollp);
```

Planes can be freely resized, though they must retain a positive size in
both dimensions. The powerful `ncplane_resize()` allows resizing an `ncplane`,
retaining all or a portion of the plane's existing content, and translating
the plane in one step. The helper function `ncplane_resize_simple()` allows
resizing an `ncplane` without movement, retaining all possible data. To move
the plane without resizing it or changing its content, use `ncplane_move_yx()`.
It is an error to invoke these functions on the standard plane.

```c
// Resize the specified ncplane. The four parameters 'keepy', 'keepx',
// 'keepleny', and 'keeplenx' define a subset of the ncplane to keep,
// unchanged. This may be a section of size 0, though none of these four
// parameters may be negative. 'keepx' and 'keepy' are relative to the ncplane.
// They must specify a coordinate within the ncplane's totality. 'yoff' and
// 'xoff' are relative to 'keepy' and 'keepx', and place the upper-left corner
// of the resized ncplane. Finally, 'ylen' and 'xlen' are the dimensions of the
// ncplane after resizing. 'ylen' must be greater than or equal to 'keepleny',
// and 'xlen' must be greater than or equal to 'keeplenx'. It is an error to
// attempt to resize the standard plane. If either of 'keepleny' or 'keeplenx'
// is non-zero, both must be non-zero.
//
// Essentially, the kept material does not move. It serves to anchor the
// resized plane. If there is no kept material, the plane can move freely.
int ncplane_resize(struct ncplane* n, int keepy, int keepx, int keepleny,
                   int keeplenx, int yoff, int xoff, int ylen, int xlen);

// Resize the plane, retaining what data we can (everything, unless we're
// shrinking in some dimension). Keep the origin where it is.
static inline int

  int oldy, oldx;

  int keeplenx = oldx > xlen ? xlen : oldx;
  return ncplane_resize(n, 0, 0, keepleny, keeplenx, 0, 0, ylen, xlen);
}

// Move this plane relative to the standard plane, or the plane to which it is

// Get the origin of this plane relative to the standard plane, or the plane to

}

// absolute coordinate relative to thte origin of 'dst'. either or both of 'y'
// and 'x' may be NULL. if 'dst' is NULL, it is taken to be the standard plane.
void ncplane_translate(const struct ncplane* src, const struct ncplane* dst,
                       int* restrict y, int* restrict x);

// Fed absolute 'y'/'x' coordinates, determine whether that coordinate is

bool ncplane_translate_abs(const struct ncplane* n, int* restrict y, int* restrict x);
```

If a given cell's glyph is zero, or its foreground channel is fully transparent,
it is considered to have no foreground. A _default_ cell can be chosen for the
`ncplane`, to be consulted in this case. If the base cell's glyph is likewise
zero (or its foreground channel fully transparent), the plane's foreground is
not rendered. Note that the base cell, like every other cell, has its own
foreground and background channels.

```c
uint16_t ncplane_styles(const struct ncplane* n);**

// Set the specified style bits for the ncplane 'n', whether they're actively
// supported or not.
void ncplane_set_styles(struct ncplane* n, unsigned stylebits);

// Add the specified styles to the ncplane's existing spec.
void ncplane_on_styles(struct ncplane* n, unsigned stylebits);

// Remove the specified styles from the ncplane's existing spec.
void ncplane_off_styles(struct ncplane* n, unsigned stylebits);

// Set the ncplane's base cell to this cell. It will be used for purposes of
// rendering anywhere that the ncplane's gcluster is 0. Erasing the ncplane
// does not reset the base cell; this function must be called with a zero 'c'.
int ncplane_set_base_cell(struct ncplane* ncp, const cell* c);

// Set the ncplane's base cell to this cell. It will be used for purposes of
// rendering anywhere that the ncplane's gcluster is 0. Erasing the ncplane
// does not reset the base cell; this function must be called with an empty
// 'egc'. 'egc' must be a single extended grapheme cluster.
int ncplane_set_base(struct ncplane* ncp, const char* egc,
                     uint32_t styles, uint64_t channels);

// Extract the ncplane's base cell into 'c'. The reference is invalidated if
// 'ncp' is destroyed.
int ncplane_base(struct ncplane* ncp, cell* c);
```

`ncplane`s are completely ordered along an imaginary z-axis. Newly-created
`ncplane`s are on the top of the stack. They can be freely reordered.

```c
// Splice ncplane 'n' out of the z-buffer, and reinsert it at the top or bottom.
void ncplane_move_top(struct ncplane* n);
void ncplane_move_bottom(struct ncplane* n);

// Splice ncplane 'n' out of the z-buffer, and reinsert it below 'below'.
// Returns non-zero if 'n' is already in the desired location. 'n' and
// 'below' must not be the same plane.
int ncplane_move_below(struct ncplane* restrict n, struct ncplane* restrict below);

// Splice ncplane 'n' out of the z-buffer, and reinsert it above 'above'.
// Returns non-zero if 'n' is already in the desired location. 'n' and
// 'above' must not be the same plane.
int ncplane_move_above(struct ncplane* restrict n, struct ncplane* restrict above);

// Return the ncplane below this one, or NULL if this is at the stack's bottom.
struct ncplane* ncplane_below(struct ncplane* n);

// Return the ncplane above this one, or NULL if this is at the stack's top.
struct ncplane* ncplane_above(struct ncplane* n);
```

Each plane holds a user pointer which can be retrieved and set (or ignored). In
addition, the plane's virtual framebuffer can be accessed (note that this does
not necessarily reflect anything on the actual screen).

```c
// Retrieve the current contents of the cell under the cursor. The EGC is
// returned, or NULL on error. This EGC must be free()d by the caller. The
// styles and channels are written to 'styles' and 'channels', respectively.
char* ncplane_at_cursor(struct ncplane* n, uint16_t* styles, uint64_t* channels);

// Retrieve the current contents of the cell under the cursor into 'c'. This

// Start at the plane's 'begy'x'begx' coordinate (which must lie on the
// plane), continuing for 'leny'x'lenx' cells. Either or both of 'leny' and
// 'lenx' can be specified as -1 to go through the boundary of the plane.
// Only glyphs from the specified blitset may be present.
uint32_t* ncplane_rgba(const struct ncplane* nc, ncblitter_e blit,
                       int begy, int begx, int leny, int lenx);

// return a nul-terminated, heap copy of the current (UTF-8) contents.
char* ncplane_contents(const struct ncplane* nc, int begy, int begx,
                           int leny, int lenx);

// Manipulate the opaque user pointer associated with this plane.
// ncplane_set_userptr() returns the previous userptr after replacing
// it with 'opaque'. the others simply return the userptr.
void* ncplane_set_userptr(struct ncplane* n, void* opaque);

```

All output is to `ncplane`s. There is no cost in moving the cursor around the
virtual framebuffer. Output that's never rendered still has some memory transfer
cost as the virtual framebuffer is prepared, but new data overwrites it in
memory.

Multiline chunks of human-readable text can be written with
`ncplane_puttext()` even if the plane does not have scrolling enabled. Such
text will be broken up across lines using the Unicode line-breaking algorithm
of [Unicode Annex #14](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-34.html).

```c
// Write the specified text to the plane, breaking lines sensibly, beginning at
// the specified line. Returns the number of columns written. When breaking a
// line, the line will be cleared to the end of the plane (the last line will
// *not* be so cleared). The number of bytes written from the input is written
// to '*bytes' if it is not NULL. Cleared columns are included in the return
// value, but *not* included in the number of bytes written. Leaves the cursor
// at the end of output. A partial write will be accomplished as far as it can;
// determine whether the write completed by inspecting '*bytes'.
int ncplane_puttext(struct ncplane* n, int y, ncalign_e align,
                    const char* text, size_t* bytes);

Lines and boxes can be drawn, interpolating their colors between their two
endpoints. For a line of a single color, be sure to specify the same channels
on both sides. Boxes allow fairly detailed specification of how they're drawn.

```c
// Draw horizontal or vertical lines using the specified cell, starting at the
// current cursor position. The cursor will end at the cell following the last
// cell output (even, perhaps counter-intuitively, when drawing vertical
// lines), just as if ncplane_putc() was called at that spot. Return the
// number of cells drawn on success. On error, return the negative number of
// cells drawn.

My 14 year-old self would never forgive me if we didn't have sweet palette
fades. The simple fade API runs the operation over a time interval, adapting
to the actual runtime, invoking a callback at each iteration.

```c
// Called for each fade iteration on 'ncp'. If anything but 0 is returned,
// the fading operation ceases immediately, and that value is propagated out.
// The recommended absolute display time target is passed in 'tspec'.
typedef int (*fadecb)(struct notcurses* nc, struct ncplane* ncp,
                      const struct timespec*, void* curry);

// Fade the ncplane out over the provided time, calling 'fader' at each
// iteration. Requires a terminal which supports truecolor, or at least palette
// modification (if the terminal uses a palette, our ability to fade planes is
// limited, and affected by the complexity of the rest of the screen).
int ncplane_fadeout(struct ncplane* n, const struct timespec* ts,
                    fadecb fader, void* curry);

// Fade the ncplane in over the specified time. Load the ncplane with the
// target cells without rendering, then call this function. When it's done, the
// ncplane will have reached the target levels, starting from zeroes.
int ncplane_fadein(struct ncplane* n, const struct timespec* ts,
                   fadecb fader, void* curry);

// Rather than the simple ncplane_fade{in/out}(), ncfadectx_setup() can be
// Pulse the plane in and out until the callback returns non-zero, relying on
// the callback 'fader' to initiate rendering. 'ts' defines the half-period
// (i.e. the transition from black to full brightness, or back again). Proper
// use involves preparing (but not rendering) an ncplane, then calling
// ncplane_pulse(), which will fade in from black to the specified colors.
int ncplane_pulse(struct ncplane* n, const struct timespec* ts, fadecb fader, void* curry);

```

The more flexible fade API allows for fine control of the process.

```c
// paired with a loop over ncplane_fade{in/out}_iteration() + ncfadectx_free().
struct ncfadectx* ncfadectx_setup(struct ncplane* n);

// Return the number of iterations through which 'nctx' will fade.
int ncfadectx_iterations(const struct ncfadectx* nctx);

// Fade out through 'iter' iterations, where
// 'iter' < 'ncfadectx_iterations(nctx)'.
int ncplane_fadeout_iteration(struct ncplane* n, struct ncfadectx* nctx,
                              int iter, fadecb fader, void* curry);

// Fade in through 'iter' iterations, where
// 'iter' < 'ncfadectx_iterations(nctx)'.
int ncplane_fadein_iteration(struct ncplane* n, struct ncfadectx* nctx,
                             int iter, fadecb fader, void* curry);

// Release the resources associated with 'nctx'.
void ncfadectx_free(struct ncfadectx* nctx);
```

Raw streams of RGBA or BGRx data can be blitted directly to an ncplane:

```c
// Blit a flat array 'data' of RGBA 32-bit values to the ncplane 'vopts->n',
// which mustn't be NULL. the blit begins at 'vopts->y' and 'vopts->x' relative
// to the specified plane. Each source row ought occupy 'linesize' bytes (this
// might be greater than 'vopts->lenx' * 4 due to padding or partial blits). A
// subregion of the input can be specified with the 'begy'x'begx' and
// 'leny'x'lenx' fields from 'vopts'. Returns the number of pixels blitted, or
// -1 on error.
int ncblit_rgba(const void* data, int linesize,
                const struct ncvisual_options* vopts);

// Same as ncblit_rgba(), but for BGRx.
int ncblit_bgrx(const void* data, int linesize,
                const struct ncvisual_options* vopts);
```

## Cells

Unlike the `notcurses` or `ncplane` objects, the definition of `cell` is
available to the user. It is somewhat ironic, then, that the user typically
needn't (and shouldn't) use `cell`s directly. Use a `cell` when the EGC being
output is used several times. In this case, time otherwise spent running
`cell_load()` (which tokenizes and verifies EGCs) can be saved. It can also be
useful to use a `cell` when the same styling is used in a discontinuous manner.

```c
// A cell corresponds to a single character cell on some plane, which can be
// occupied by a single grapheme cluster (some root spacing glyph, along with
// possible combining characters, which might span multiple columns). At any
// cell, we can have a theoretically arbitrarily long UTF-8 string, a foreground
// color, a background color, and an attribute set. Valid grapheme cluster
// contents include:
//
//  * A NUL terminator,
//  * A single control character, followed by a NUL terminator,
//  * At most one spacing character, followed by zero or more nonspacing
//    characters, followed by a NUL terminator.
//
// Multi-column characters can only have a single style/color throughout.
//
// Each cell occupies 16 static bytes (128 bits). The surface is thus ~1.6MB
// for a (pretty large) 500x200 terminal. At 80x43, it's less than 64KB.
// Dynamic requirements can add up to 16MB to an ncplane, but such large pools
// are unlikely in common use.
//
// We implement some small alpha compositing. Foreground and background both
// have two bits of inverted alpha. The actual grapheme written to a cell is
// the topmost non-zero grapheme. If its alpha is 00, its foreground color is
// used unchanged. If its alpha is 10, its foreground color is derived entirely
// from cells underneath it. Otherwise, the result will be a composite.
// Likewise for the background. If the bottom of a coordinate's zbuffer is
// reached with a cumulative alpha of zero, the default is used. In this way,
// a terminal configured with transparent background can be supported through
// multiple occluding ncplanes. A foreground alpha of 11 requests high-contrast
// text (relative to the computed background). A background alpha of 11 is
// currently forbidden.
//
// Default color takes precedence over palette or RGB, and cannot be used with
// transparency. Indexed palette takes precedence over RGB. It cannot
// meaningfully set transparency, but it can be mixed into a cascading color.
// RGB is used if neither default terminal colors nor palette indexing are in
// play, and fully supports all transparency options.
typedef struct cell {
  // These 32 bits, together with the associated plane's associated egcpool,
  // completely define this cell's EGC. Unless the EGC requires more than four
  // bytes to encode as UTF-8, it will be inlined here. If more than four bytes
  // are required, it will be spilled into the egcpool. In either case, there's
  // a NUL-terminated string available without copying, because (1) the egcpool
  // is all NUL-terminated sequences and (2) the fifth byte of this struct (the
  // gcluster_backstop field, see below) is guaranteed to be zero, as are any
  // unused bytes in gcluster.
  //
  // A spilled EGC is indicated by the value 0x01XXXXXX. This cannot alias a
  // true supra-ASCII EGC, because UTF-8 only encodes bytes <= 0x80 when they
  // are single-byte ASCII-derived values. The XXXXXX is interpreted as a 24-bit
  // index into the egcpool. These pools may thus be up to 16MB.
  //
  // The cost of this scheme is that the character 0x01 (SOH) cannot be encoded
  // in a cell, which is absolutely fine because what 70s horseshit is SOH? It

`cell`s must be initialized with an initialization macro or `cell_init()`
before any other use. `cell_init()` and `CELL_TRIVIAL_INITIALIZER` both
simply zero out the `cell`.

```c
#define CELL_TRIVIAL_INITIALIZER { }
#define CELL_CHAR_INITIALIZER(c) { .gcluster = (c), .gcluster_backstop = 0, .reserved = 0, .stylemask = 0, .channels = 0, }
#define CELL_INITIALIZER(c, s, chan) { .gcluster = (c), .gcluster_backstop = 0, .reserved = 0, .stylemask = (s), .channels = (chan), }

static inline void
cell_init(cell* c){
  memset(c, 0, sizeof(*c));
}
```

A `cell` has three fundamental elements:

* The EGC displayed at this coordinate, encoded in UTF-8. If the EGC is a
  single ASCII character (value less than 0x80), it is stored inline in
  the `cell`'s `gcluster` field. Otherwise, `gcluster`'s top 24 bits
  are a 128-biased offset into the associated `ncplane`'s egcpool. This
  implies that `cell`s are associated with `ncplane`s once prepared.
* The Curses-style attributes of the text.
* The 52 bits of foreground and background RGBA (2x8/8/8/2), plus a few flags.

The EGC should be loaded using `cell_load()`. Either a single NUL-terminated
EGC can be provided, or a string composed of multiple EGCs. In the latter case,
the first EGC from the string is loaded. Remember, backing storage for the EGC
is provided by the `ncplane` passed to `cell_load()`; if this `ncplane` is
destroyed (or even erased), the `cell` cannot safely be used. If you're done
using the `cell` before being done with the `ncplane`, call `cell_release()`
to free up the EGC resources.

```c
// Breaks the UTF-8 string in 'gcluster' down, setting up the cell 'c'. Returns
// the number of bytes copied out of 'gcluster', or -1 on failure. The styling
// of the cell is left untouched, but any resources are released.

## Reels

ncreels are a complex UI abstraction offered by notcurses, derived from my
similar work in [outcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/ncreels#ncreels).

The ncreel is a UI abstraction supported by Notcurses in which
dynamically-created and -destroyed toplevel entities (referred to as tablets)
are arranged as if on a cylinder, allowing for infinite scrolling
(infinite scrolling can be disabled, resulting in a rectangle rather than a
cylinder). This works naturally with keyboard navigation, mouse scrolling wheels,
and touchpads (including the capacitive touchscreens of modern cell phones).
The term "reel" derives from slot machines. An ncreel initially has
no tablets; at any given time thereafter, it has zero or more tablets, and if
there is at least one tablet, one tablet is focused (and on-screen). If the
last tablet is removed, no tablet is focused. A tablet can support navigation
within the tablet, in which case there is an in-tablet focus for the focused
tablet, which can also move among elements within the tablet.

The ncreel object tracks the size of the screen, the size, number,
information depth, and order of tablets, and the foci. It also draws the
optional borders around tablets and the optional border of the reel itself. It
knows nothing about the actual content of a tablet, save the number of lines it
occupies at each information depth. The typical control flow is that an
application receives events (from the UI or other event sources), and calls
into Notcurses saying e.g. "Tablet 2 now has 40 valid lines of information".
notcurses might then call back into the application, asking it to draw some
line(s) from some tablet(s) at some particular coordinate of that tablet's
plane. Finally, control returns to the application, and the cycle starts anew.

Each tablet might be wholly, partially, or not on-screen. Notcurses always
places as much of the focused tablet as is possible on-screen (if the focused
tablet has more lines than the actual reel does, it cannot be wholly on-screen.
In this case, the focused subelements of the tablet are always on-screen). The
placement of the focused tablet depends on how it was reached (when moving to
the next tablet, offscreen tablets are brought onscreen at the bottom. When
moving to the previous tablet, offscreen tablets are brought onscreen at the
top. When moving to an arbitrary tablet which is neither the next nor previous
tablet, it will be placed in the center).

The controlling application can, at any time,

* Insert a new tablet somewhere in the reel (possibly off-screen)
* Delete a (possibly off-screen) tablet from the reel
* Change focus to the next or previous tablet, bringing it on-screen if it is off
* Change focus to some arbitrary other tablet, bringing it on-screen if it is off
* Expand or collapse the information depth of a tablet
* Change the content of a tablet, updating it if it is on-screen
  * Remove content from a tablet, possibly resizing it, and possibly changing focus within the tablet
  * Add content to the tablet, possibly resizing it, and possibly creating focus within the tablet
* Navigate within the focused tablet
* Create or destroy new planes atop the ncreel
* Indicate that the screen has been resized or needs be redrawn

A special case arises when moving among the tablets of a reel having multiple
tablets, all of which fit entirely on-screen, and infinite scrolling is in use.
Normally, upon moving to the next tablet from the bottommost tablet, the
(offscreen) next tablet is pulled up into the bottom of the reel (the reverse
is true when moving to the previous tablet from the topmost). When all tablets
are onscreen with infinite scrolling, there are two possibilities: either the
focus scrolls (moving from the bottom tablet to the top tablet, for instance),
or the reel scrolls (preserving order among the tablets, but changing their
order on-screen). In this latter case, moving to the next tablet from the
bottommost tablet results in the tablet which is gaining focus being brought to
the bottom of the screen from the top, and all other tablets moving up on the
screen. Moving to the previous tablet from the topmost tablet results in the
bottommost tablet moving to the top of the screen, and all other tablets moving
down. This behavior matches the typical behavior precisely, and avoids a rude
UI discontinuity when the tablets grow to fill the entire screen (or shrink to
not fill it). If it is not desired, however, scrolling of focus can be
configured instead.

```c
// An ncreel is a Notcurses region devoted to displaying zero or more
// line-oriented, contained tablets between which the user may navigate. If at
// least one tablets exists, there is a "focused tablet". As much of the focused
// tablet as is possible is always displayed. If there is space left over, other
// tablets are included in the display. Tablets can come and go at any time, and
// can grow or shrink at any time.

### ncreel examples

Let's say we have a screen of 11 lines, and 3 tablets of one line each. Both
a screen border and tablet borders are in use. The tablets are A, B, and C.
No gap is in use between tablets. Xs indicate focus. If B currently has focus,
and the next tablet is selected, the result would be something like:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   A   | |                         | |   A   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "next tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |   B   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |XX C XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

If instead the previous tablet had been selected, we would of course get:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   A   | |                         | |XX A XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "prev tablet" ---> | --------- |
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |   B   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |   C   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

If A instead has the focus, choosing the "next tablet" is trivial: the tablets
do not change, and focus shifts to B. If we choose the "previous tablet", there
are three possibilities:

* Finite scrolling: No change. The tablets stay in place. A remains focused.

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |XX A XX| |                         | |XX A XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- | ---- "prev tablet" ---> | --------- |

 -------------                         -------------
```

* Infinite scrolling with focus rotation: Focus shifts to C, and moves to the bottom:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- |

 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |XX C XX| |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

Now imagine us to have the same 3 tablets, but each is now 4 lines. It is
impossible to have two of these tablets wholly onscreen at once, let alone all
three. If we started with A focused and at the top, the result after all three
tablets have grown will be:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- | A remains at the top, and
 | |XX A XX| |                         | |XXXXXXX| | is wholly on-screen. B is
 | --------- |                         | |XX A XX| | below it, but we can show
 | --------- | ---- "grow tablet" ---> | |XXXXXXX| | only the first two lines.
 | |   B   | |       A (focused)       | |XXXXXXX| | C has been pushed
 | --------- |                         | --------- | off-screen.
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |       | |
 | --------- |                         | |   B   | |
 -------------                         -------------
```

When a tablet is enlarged, it grows towards the nearest boundary, unless that
would result in the focused tablet being moved, in which case the growing
tablet instead grows in the other direction (if the tablet is in the middle
of the screen exactly, it grows down). There is one exception to this rule: if
the tablets are not making full use of the screen, growth is always down (the
screen is always filled from the top), even if it moves the focused tablet.

A 12-line screen has three tablets: A (2 lines), B (1 line), C (1 line), filling
the screen exactly. B is focused, and grows two lines:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | --------- | B grows down, since it is
 | |   A   | |                         | |   A   | | closer to the bottom (3
 | |       | |                         | |       | | lines) than the top (4
 | --------- | ---- "grow tablet" ---> | --------- | lines). C is pushed almost
 | --------- |       B (focused)       | --------- | entirely off-screen. A is
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |XXXXXXX| | untouched.
 | --------- |                         | |XX B XX| |
 | --------- |                         | |XXXXXXX| |
 | |   C   | |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

Starting with the same situation, A grows by 2 lines instead:

```
 -------------                         -------------
 | --------- |                         | |       | | A grows up. It would have
 | |   A   | |                         | |   A   | | grown down, but that would
 | |       | |                         | |       | | have moved B, which has
 | --------- | ---- "grow tablet" ---> | --------- | the focus. B and C remain
 | --------- |     A (not focused)     | --------- | where they are; A moves
 | |XX B XX| |                         | |XX B XX| | partially off-screen.
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 | |   C   | |                         | |   C   | |
 | --------- |                         | --------- |
 -------------                         -------------
```

If we started with the same situation, and B grew by 7 lines, it would first
push C entirely off-screen (B would then have four lines of text), and then
push A off-screen. B would then have eight lines of text, the maximum on a
12-line screen with both types of borders.

## Channels

A channel encodes 24 bits of RGB color, using 8 bits for each component. It
additionally provides 2 bits of alpha channel, a bit for selecting terminal
default colors, and a bit to indicate whether it describes a Wide East Asian
character. The remaining four bits are reserved. Typically two channels are
bound together in a 64-bit unsigned integer (`uint64_t`), with eight bits
currently going unused. There is such a double-channel in every `cell` and
`ncplane` object.

Usually, the higher-level `ncplane` and `cell` functionality ought be used. It
will sometimes be necessary, however, to muck with channels at their lowest
level. The channel API facilitates such muckery. All channel-related `ncplane`
and `cell` functionality is implemented in terms of this API.

```c
// Extract the 8-bit red component from a 32-bit channel.

## Visuals

`ncvisual`s are virtual pixel framebuffers. They can be operated upon using
familiar pixel graphics routines, and then rendered to a (character-
graphics) plane using a variety of blitting methods:

* Space with background color -- the only blitter that works in ASCII
  mode. 1:1 pixels map losslessly to 2:1 cells.
* Unicode upper- and lower-half blocks (▀ and ▄, respectively). 2:1 pixels
  map losslessly to 2:1 cells. The default blitting mode.
* Unicode half blocks plus quadrants. 2x2 pixels map to 2:1 cells.
* Braille. 4:2 pixels map to 2:1 cells. Useful when only two colors are needed
  in a small area, due to high resolution.

It is most typicaly to prepare `ncvisual`s from files on disk (see 
[Multimedia](#multimedia) below); this requires Notcurses to be built against
a multimedia engine. Even without such an engine, `ncvisual`s can be
constructed directly from RGBA or BGRA 8bpc memory:

```c
// Prepare an ncvisual, and its underlying plane, based off RGBA content in
// memory at 'rgba'. 'rgba' must be a flat array of 32-bit 8bpc RGBA pixels.
// These must be arranged in 'rowstride' lines, where the first 'cols' * 4b
// are actual data. There must be 'rows' lines. The total size of 'rgba'
// must thus be at least (rows * rowstride) bytes, of which (rows * cols * 4)
// bytes are actual data. The resulting plane will be ceil('rows'/2)x'cols'.
struct ncvisual* ncvisual_from_rgba(struct notcurses* nc, const void* rgba,
                                    int rows, int rowstride, int cols);

// ncvisual_from_rgba(), but for BGRA.
struct ncvisual* ncvisual_from_bgra(struct notcurses* nc, const void* bgra,
                                    int rows, int rowstride, int cols);
```

`ncvisual`s can also be loaded from the contents of a plane:

```c
// Promote an ncplane 'n' to an ncvisual. The plane may contain only spaces,
// half blocks, and full blocks. The latter will be checked, and any other
// glyph will result in a NULL being returned. This function exists so that
// planes can be subjected to ncvisual transformations. If possible, it's
// better to create the ncvisual from memory using ncvisual_from_rgba().
struct ncvisual* ncvisual_from_plane(const struct ncplane* n, ncblitter_e blit,
                                     int begy, int begx, int leny, int lenx);
```

Various transformations can be applied to an `ncvisual`, regardless of how
it was built up:

```c
// Get the size and ratio of ncvisual pixels to output cells along the y
// ('toy') and x ('tox') axes. A ncvisual of '*y'X'*x' pixels will require
// ('*y' * '*toy')X('x' * 'tox') cells for full output. Returns non-zero
// for an invalid 'vopts->blitter'. Scaling is taken into account.

And finally, the `ncvisual` can be blitted to one or more `ncplane`s:

```c
// Render the decoded frame to the specified ncplane (if one is not provided,
// one will be created, having the exact size necessary to display the visual.
// In this case, 'style' must be NCSTYLE_NONE). A subregion of the visual can
// be rendered using 'begx', 'begy', 'lenx', and 'leny'. Negative values for
// 'begy' or 'begx' are an error. It is an error to specify any region beyond
// the boundaries of the frame. Returns the plane to which we drew (if ncv->n
// is NULL, a new plane will be created).

                                    const struct ncvisual_options* vopts);

// decode the next frame ala ncvisual_decode(), but if we have reached the end,
// rewind to the first frame of the ncvisual. a subsequent `ncvisual_render()`
// will render the first frame, as if the ncvisual had been closed and reopened.
// the return values remain the same as those of ncvisual_decode().

                         const struct timespec* tspec, void* curry){

// return a positive number to indicate intentional abort from within
// streamer(). 'timescale' allows the frame duration time to be scaled. For a
// visual naturally running at 30FPS, a 'timescale' of 0.1 will result in

### QR codes

If build with libqrcodegen support, `ncplane_qrcode()` can be used to draw
a QR code for arbitrary data.

```c
// Draw a QR code at the current position on the plane. If there is insufficient
// room to draw the code here, or there is any other error, non-zero will be
// returned. Otherwise, the QR code "version" (size) is returned. The QR code
// is (version * 4 + 17) columns wide, and ⌈version * 4 + 17⌉ rows tall (the
// properly-scaled values are written back to '*ymax' and '*xmax').
int ncplane_qrcode(struct ncplane* n, ncblitter_e blitter, int* ymax,
                   int* xmax, const void* data, size_t len);
```


### Multimedia

When compiled against a suitable engine (FFmpeg and OpenImageIO are both
currently supported), Notcurses can populate a visual with pixels decoded
from an image or video using `ncvisual_from_file()`. Once opened,
`ncvisual_decode()` should be used to extract each frame (an image will
have only one frame), until it returns `NCERR_EOF`:

```c
// Open a visual at 'file', extracting a codec and parameters.
struct ncvisual* ncvisual_from_file(const char* file);


// extract the next frame from an ncvisual. returns NCERR_EOF on end of file,
// and NCERR_SUCCESS on success, otherwise some other NCERR.
int ncvisual_decode(struct ncvisual* nc);
```

### Pixels

It is sometimes desirable to modify the pixels of an `ncvisual` directly.

```c
static inline int
ncpixel_set_r(uint32_t* pixel, int r){
  if(r > 255 || r < 0){
    return -1;
  }
  *pixel = (*pixel & 0xffffff00ul) | (r);
  return 0;
}

static inline int
ncpixel_set_g(uint32_t* pixel, int g){
  if(g > 255 || g < 0){
    return -1;
  }
  *pixel = (*pixel & 0xff00fffful) | (g << 16u);
  return 0;
}

static inline int
ncpixel_set_b(uint32_t* pixel, int b){
  if(b > 255 || b < 0){
    return -1;
  }
  *pixel = (*pixel & 0xffff00fful) | (b << 8u);
  return 0;
}

// set the RGB values of an RGB pixel
static inline int
ncpixel_set_rgb8(uint32_t* pixel, int r, int g, int b){
  if(pixel_set_r(pixel, r) || pixel_set_g(pixel, g) || pixel_set_b(pixel, b)){
    return -1;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Stats

Notcurses supplies a number of stats related to performance and state.
Cumulative stats can be reset at any time.

```c
typedef struct ncstats {
  // purely increasing stats
  uint64_t renders;          // number of successful notcurses_render() runs
  uint64_t failed_renders;   // number of aborted renders, should be 0
  uint64_t render_bytes;     // bytes emitted to ttyfp
  int64_t render_max_bytes;  // max bytes emitted for a frame
  int64_t render_min_bytes;  // min bytes emitted for a frame
  uint64_t render_ns;        // nanoseconds spent in render+raster
  int64_t render_max_ns;     // max ns spent in render+raster for a frame
  int64_t render_min_ns;     // min ns spent in render+raster for a frame
  uint64_t writeout_ns;      // nanoseconds spent writing frames to terminal
  int64_t writeout_max_ns;   // max ns spent writing out a frame
  int64_t writeout_min_ns;   // min ns spent writing out a frame
  uint64_t cellelisions;     // cells we elided entirely thanks to damage maps
  uint64_t cellemissions;    // total number of cells emitted to terminal
  uint64_t fgelisions;       // RGB fg elision count
  uint64_t fgemissions;      // RGB fg emissions
  uint64_t bgelisions;       // RGB bg elision count
  uint64_t bgemissions;      // RGB bg emissions
  uint64_t defaultelisions;  // default color was emitted
  uint64_t defaultemissions; // default color was elided

  // current state -- these can decrease
  uint64_t fbbytes;          // total bytes devoted to all active framebuffers
  unsigned planes;           // number of planes currently in existence
} ncstats;

// Allocate an ncstats object. Use this rather than allocating your own, since
// future versions of Notcurses might enlarge this structure.
ncstats* notcurses_stats_alloc(const struct notcurses* nc);

// Acquire an atomic snapshot of the Notcurses object's stats.
void notcurses_stats(const struct notcurses* nc, ncstats* stats);

// Reset all cumulative stats (immediate ones, such as fbbytes, are not reset).
void notcurses_stats_reset(struct notcurses* nc, ncstats* stats);
```


## C++

Marek Habersack has contributed (and maintains) C++ wrappers installed to
`include/ncpp/`, `libnotcurses++.so`, and `libnotcurses++.a`.

In their default mode, these wrappers throw exceptions only from the type 
constructors (RAII). If `NCPP_EXCEPTIONS_PLEASE` is defined prior to including 
any NCPP headers, they will throw exceptions.
